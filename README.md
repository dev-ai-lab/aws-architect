![img.png](media/architect-path.png)
- exam code SAA-C03: 
- AWS: 2002 (internal launch) --> 2003 (ideation to market) --> 2004(launched publicly with SQS) --> 2006(Relaunch with SQS, S3, EC2) --> 2007(launched in Europe) --> Netflix, NASA, AirBnB, Dropbox
- AWS > Azure > Google Cloud
- AWS:
  - enables to build sophisticated, scalable applications
  - applicable to diverse set of industries
  - Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data Analytics
  - Website hosting, Backend for mobile and social application
  - Gaming
- AWS global infrastructure: 
  - Aws regions
  - Aws AZ
  - Aws Data Centers
  - Aws Edge locations / Points of Presence
- Choice of region:
  - compliance
  - proximity: reduce latency
  - availability of services
  - pricing: varies based on region
- Availability Zones:
  - per region min 3 and max 6 AZ
  - each zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power and networking

![AWS-region-az.png](media/AWS-region-az.png)

![Region-Az](media/region-az.png)
  
- AWS Point of Presence (Edge Location):
  - 400+ PS (400+ Edge locations & 10+ Regional Cache) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
  - Aim: content is delivered to end-user with lower latency
- AWS Services:
  1. Global services:
     - IAM
     - Route 53 (DNS service)
     - CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
     - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
  2. Region-Scoped
     - EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
     - Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
     - Lambda (Function as a Service)
     - Rekogniation (Software as a Service)
## How to access AWS:
- There are 3 ways to access aws:
  - AWS management console (Web UI)
  - AWS CLI (`>aws`): protected by access key
  - AWS cloudshell: download and upload files. Files created will remain there even if shell is closed
  - AWS SDK from code: protected by access key. For each programming language, there is a separate sdk
- Access keys are generated through AWS console, managed by each user. They are just like a pwd.
### Install aws cli on MacOS:
- Follow these [steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html): 
- Create access keys: it can be created only for a user, not for root. Go to user --> security credentials --> Create Access Key --> CLI key
Recommended alternative: Use the AWS CLI V2 and enable authentication through a user in IAM Identity Center.
```
 ~ % aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA2XXVXXVDXANC
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: Basfhv/xxxxxx/QxysfdfFGDlkerws
Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
Default output format [None]:
~ % aws iam list-users
```

## IAM
- You manage access to AWS by creating policies and attaching them to **IAM identities** (users, groups, roles) or aws resources
- Simply put: certain actions can be performed on aws services i.e S3 --> we allow a set of those actions by creating a policy and selecting those actions
  - we then assign this policy to IAM identities or resources.
- **Terms definitions**:
  - Policy: a policy is an object in AWS, that when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions
  - Resource-based policy: it is a json policy document that one attaches to a resource such as S3 bucket 
    - It gives specific principal permission to perform certain actions on that resource given a set of conditions
    - the principal can be in the same account as the resource or in another account (cross-account access)
    - cross-account access is possible only with `Resource-based policy`
  - Trust policy: defines which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume a role. An IAM role is both an identity and a resource
    - we attach both a trust policy and indentity-based policy to an IAM role.
  ```
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": {
                  "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
              },
              "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
- Root account shouldn't be used or shared
- Users: people that can be grouped
- Group: contains only users and not other groups
  - group `developers` --> [ahmad, alice, kai], group `operations` --> [david, edward], group `audit team` --> [kai, david]
- Users don't have to belong to a group
- A user can belong to multiple groups

![aws-iam](media/aws-iam.png)
- **IAM Permissions**:
  - Users and groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
  - Policy: a json document that defines a set of permissions to making requests to aws services that can be used by IAM users, User groups and IAM roles
  - Permissions defined in a policy

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",  // The version of the policy language. This is a fixed value.
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",  // Defines whether the action on certain API is allowed or denied. In this case, it allows the action. i.e Allow, Denied
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",  // Specifies the action. In this case, it allows listing the contents of an S3 bucket.
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": ["arn:aws:iam::123456:root"] // which accounts, user or role
      },
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",  // Specifies the resource (an S3 bucket) that the action applies to.
      "Condition": {},
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",  // This block allows the next action
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",    // Allows downloading objects from the S3 bucket.
        "s3:PutObject"     // Allows uploading objects to the S3 bucket.
      ],
      "Resource": [ // Allows the actions on any objects within the example-bucket.
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket-2/*"
       ]  
    }
  ]
}

```
  - Apply least privilege principle
  - Procedure: create user --> create group and assign to user --> create an account alias to ease of sign in --> share the link with pass to the user
  - Another example of policy `IAMReadOnlyAccess` with `iam:Get*` meaning anything that starts with `Get`

                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
  - You can create your own policies:

![Create Policy](media/create-policy.png)

  - Password Policy: Set min length, char requirements, password expiration
    - A password policy for the entire aws users:
      - set a password policy for the entire aws account

![password policy](media/setup-pwd-policy.png)

  - Root user security policy such as MFA: Go to `My security credentials`

- **IAM Roles for Services**
  - Refer to the main diagram under IAM
  - Some aws services needs to perform actions on your behalf
  - To do so, we assign permissions to AWS services with IAM roles
  - account vs user vs role
  - Common roles: 
    - EC2 instance roles
    - Lambda Func Roles
    - Roles for cloud formation
  - Create a Role: go to iam roles --> select aws service --> select the service (i.e EC2) --> select the usecase --> attach IAM policies to the role (i.e IAMReadOnly)

- **IAM security tools**
  - IAM audit:
    - IAM `Credential Report`: status of users and their credentials. At `Account-level`
    - IAM `Access Advisor`: permissions granted and when were last used. At `User-level`: Go to user --> go to user's `Last Accessed`

- **IAM best practices**
  - Don't use the root account except when creating aws account
  - One physical user = one aws user
  - Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
  - Use strong password policy
  - Use MFA
  - Give Roles to aws services when giving permissions to aws services
  - Use access keys
  - Use IAM reports

### IAM Organization
- **Global service** for managing multiple AWS accounts.
- **Management account** oversees the organization; others are **member accounts**.
- **Member accounts** can belong to only one organization.
- **Consolidated Billing**: Single payment method for all accounts.
- **Cost savings**: Aggregated usage leads to volume discounts (EC2, S3, etc.).
- **Shared discounts**: Reserved Instances & Savings Plans apply across accounts.
- **Automation**: API available for AWS account creation.
![iam-organization.png](media/iam/iam-organization.png)
- **Advantages**
  - **Multi-Account vs. One Account Multi-VPC**: Better isolation and management.
  - **Tagging Standards**: Simplifies billing and cost tracking.
  - **Centralized Logging**:
    - Enable **CloudTrail** on all accounts, store logs in a central **S3** account.
    - Send **CloudWatch Logs** to a central logging account.
  - **Cross-Account Roles**: Simplifies admin access management.
- **Security ‚Äì Service Control Policies (SCPs)**
  - Apply **IAM-like policies** at **OU** or **account** level to restrict users and roles.
  - **Management account is not affected** (has full admin rights).
  - **Explicit allow required** from root ‚Üí OU ‚Üí target account (default deny, like IAM).

  ```
- `aws:PrincipalOrgID` can be used in any resource policies to restrict access to accounts that are member of an AWS Organization
![iam-principal-org-id.png](media/iam/iam-principal-org-id.png)

### IAM Roles vs Resource Based Policies - Cross account
- attaching a resource-based policy to a resource (example: S3 bucket policy) 
- OR using a role as a proxy
- When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take the permissions assigned to the role 
- When using a resource-based policy, the principal doesn‚Äôt have to give up his permissions 
  - Example: User in account A needs to scan a DynamoDB table in Account A and dump it in an S3 bucket in Account B. 
  - Supported by: Amazon S3 buckets, SNS topics, SQS queues, etc...

![iam-role-vs-resource-policy.png](media/iam/iam-role-vs-resource-policy.png)

**Amazon EventBridge - Security:**
- When a rule runs, it needs permissions on the target 
  - Resource-based policy: Lambda, SNS, SQS, S3 buckets, API Rule Gateway... 
  - IAM role: Kinesis stream, Systems Manager Run Command, ECS task...

![eventbridge-iam-role-vs-policy.png](media/iam/eventbridge-iam-role-vs-policy.png)

**IAM Permission Boundary & Policy Evaluation:**
- IAM Permission Boundaries are supported for users and roles (`not groups)
- Advanced feature to use a managed policy to set the maximum permissions an IAM entity can get.
![img.png](media/iam/iam-permission-boundary.png)
- Can be used in combinations of AWS Organizations SCP
- Use cases:
  - Delegate responsibilities to non administrators within their permission boundaries, for example create new IAM users
  - Allow developers to self-assign policies and manage their own permissions, while making sure they can‚Äôt ‚Äúescalate‚Äù their privileges (= make themselves admin)
  - Useful to restrict one specific user (instead of a whole account using Organizations & SCP)
![iam-permission-boundary-2.png](media/iam/iam-permission-boundary-2.png)

- IAM Policy Evaluation Logic

![iam-policy-evaluation-logic.png](media/iam/iam-policy-evaluation-logic.png)
- Example:
  - Answer:
    - Can you perform `sqs:CreateQueue`?
    - Can you perform `sqs:DeleteQueue`?
    - Can you perform `ec2:DescribeInstances`? No, because there is no explicit deny or allow

![iam-policy-evaluation-example.png](media/iam/iam-policy-evaluation-example.png)


### AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On)
- Provides a single sign-on (SSO) solution for accessing:
  - All AWS accounts within AWS Organizations
  - Business cloud applications (e.g., Salesforce, Box, Microsoft 365)
  - SAML 2.0-enabled applications
  - EC2 Windows instances
  - Identity providers:
    - Built-in identity store within IAM Identity Center
    - Third-party providers such as Active Directory (AD), OneLogin, and Okta

Login Flow:

![img.png](media/iam/identity-center-login-flow.png)

AWS IAM Identity Center:

![iam-identity-center.png](media/iam/iam-identity-center.png)

Permission sets assigned to a set of users
![ou-users-mgmt-id-center.png](media/iam/ou-users-mgmt-id-center.png)

AWS IAM Identity Center Fine-grained Permissions and Assignments:
- Multi-Account Permissions
  - Manage access across AWS accounts in your AWS Organization
  - Permission Sets ‚Äì a collection of one or more IAM Policies assigned to users and groups to define AWS access
- Application Assignments
  - SSO access to many SAML 2.0 business applications (Salesforce, Box, Microsoft 365)
  - Provide required URLs, certificates, and metadata
  - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
    - Fine-grained permissions based on users‚Äô attributes stored in IAM Identity Center Identity Store
    - Example:cost center,title,locale,...
    - Use case:Define permissions once,then modify AWS access by changing the attributes

![iam-id-center-fine-grained-permissions.png](media/iam/iam-id-center-fine-grained-permissions.png)

**IAM Roles Anywhere** is a feature in AWS that enables you to securely grant access to AWS resources from **outside** AWS (e.g., on-premises servers, or other cloud environments) using **IAM roles**. It works with **IAM Identity Center** to allow users and applications to assume IAM roles by leveraging **X.509 certificates** for authentication, instead of relying solely on traditional AWS credentials.

In the context of **IAM Identity Center**, it helps extend centralized identity and access management to external environments, offering seamless, secure access to AWS resources regardless of the user's or application's location.

### AWS Directory Services

![aws-directory-service.png](media/iam/aws-directory-service.png)

#### **1. AWS Managed Microsoft AD**
- **Effort**: Higher upfront setup, but offers deep integration and long-term flexibility.
- **Use case**: Ideal if you want a fully managed AD in AWS with support for trust relationships.
- **Setup steps**:
  - Deploy AWS Managed Microsoft AD in your VPC.
  - Configure a two-way trust with your on-premises AD.
  - IAM Identity Center can natively integrate with the managed AD‚Äîno extra proxy or directory required.
- **User management**: You can either manage users in AWS AD or use on-prem users via trust.
- Supports MFA, group sync, and attribute mappings.
- More effort initially (trusts, networking, DNS, etc.), but better for scalability and centralized control.

![aws-id-center-active-dir.png](media/iam/aws-id-center-active-dir.png)
---

#### **2. AD Connector**
- Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-premises AD
- Users are managed on the on-premises AD
- **Effort**: Lower effort and faster setup, but with fewer features.
- **Use case**: Best for scenarios where you want to reuse your on-prem AD users directly without replicating or extending AD into AWS.
- **Setup steps**:
  - Deploy an AD Connector in your VPC.
  - Point it to your on-premises AD (requires VPN or Direct Connect).
  - IAM Identity Center connects through the AD Connector as a proxy to authenticate users.
- All user management stays on-prem, with no user duplication.
- Supports MFA, but limited to authentication use cases‚Äîno group sync or advanced policies from AWS side.
- Easiest to set up, but less flexibility in advanced identity features.

![aws-id-center-self-mgmt-ad.png](media/iam/aws-id-center-self-mgmt-ad.png)

---
#### Simple AD
  - AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
  - Cannot be joined with on-premises AD

#### Demo:

### AWS Control Tower - a service on top of the organization
- Easy way to set up and govern a secure and compliant multi-account- AWS environment based on best practices
- AWS Control Tower uses AWS Organizations to create accounts
- Benefits:
  - Automate the setup of your environment in a few clicks 
  - Automate ongoing policy management using guardrails
  - Detect policy violations and remediate them
  - Monitor compliance through an interactive dashboard

AWS Control Tower ‚Äì Guardrails
  - Provides ongoing governance for your Control Tower environment (AWS Accounts)
    - Preventive Guardrail ‚Äì using SCPs (e.g., Restrict Regions across all your accounts)
    - Detective Guardrail ‚Äì using AWS Config (e.g., identify untagged resources)

![aws-control-tower-guardrails.png](media/iam/aws-control-tower-guardrails.png)

## EC2 Service (Elastic Compute Cloud) - Infras as a service
- Think of it as a computer in the cloud. It‚Äôs where you can run applications, websites, or other tasks, just like you would on your laptop or a physical server.
- You can choose the size, speed, and capacity of this "cloud computer" based on what you need
*Notes about budget alerts*:
1. In root account, activate it: accounts --> IAM user and roll access to billing information
2. Setting up budget to avoid surprisings: account --> budgets --> setup i.e zero spend budget --> add email
### EC2 Capabilities
EC2 or elastic computing 2 is infrastructure as a service
- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
- Scaling services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- EC2 instance [types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/?nc1=h_ls)
- A comparison of different instance types [see](https://instances.vantage.sh/).
- For demo purposes, we will use t2.micro
- Fundamental part of cloud
- `Detailed monitoring`:
  - When launching, enable this under monitoring to get 1-minute metrics instead of 5-minutes metrics in basic monitoring.
- User Data:
  - executed with root privilege 
  - executed during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance
- User Data Example:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Use this for your user data (script from top to bottom)
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

![ec2-summary.png](media/ec2-summary.png)

![ec2-summary-part-2.png](media/ec2-summary-part-2.png)
- Patch test:
  - put `ReplaceUnhealthy` in standby or 
  - put instance into standby state
### EC2 Purchasing Options

1. **On-Demand Instances**:
  - **Description**: These are the most flexible EC2 instances. You pay for compute capacity by the second or hour, with no long-term commitment or upfront payments.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads or applications that cannot be interrupted.

2. **Reserved Instances**:
  - **Description**: Reserved Instances provide a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for committing to a specific instance type and region for a one or three-year term.
  - **Types**:
    - **Standard Reserved Instances**: Fixed instance type and region.
    - **Convertible Reserved Instances**: Can be exchanged for other instance types, but still within a specific region.
    - **Scheduled Reserved Instances**: Reserved for specific time windows.
  - **Use Case**: Best for predictable, steady-state usage.

3. **Spot Instances**:
  - **Description**: These are unused EC2 capacity available at a reduced price. Spot Instances can be interrupted by AWS with little notice, typically when the demand for EC2 capacity increases.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable for flexible, fault-tolerant applications, like big data processing or batch jobs, that can handle interruptions.

4. **Spot Fleet**:
  - **Description**: Spot Fleet is a collection of Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand Instances) that is managed as a single entity. You can use Spot Fleet to automatically request, manage, and scale Spot Instances across multiple instance types and Availability Zones, based on your target capacity.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for large-scale, stateless, distributed workloads (like batch processing or simulations) that can tolerate interruptions and require flexible scaling across multiple instance types and zones.

5. **Savings Plans**:
  - **Description**: A flexible pricing model offering lower prices in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hr) over a one- or three-year term.
  - **Types**:
    - **Compute Savings Plans**: Flexibility to switch between instance types, operating systems, and regions.
    - **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**: Commitment to specific EC2 instance families and regions.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for businesses with predictable compute needs that want the flexibility to change instance types, regions, and OS over time.

6. **Dedicated Hosts**:
  - **Description**: Physical servers dedicated to your use. You can launch EC2 instances on these hosts and have full control over how instances are placed on the server.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for workloads that require compliance, licensing, or need a specific physical server.

7. **Dedicated Instances**:
  - **Description**: EC2 instances that run on hardware dedicated to a single customer. Unlike Dedicated Hosts, they don‚Äôt give you control over instance placement.
  - **Use Case**: Suitable for workloads that require isolation but do not need the full control of Dedicated Hosts.

8. **Elastic GPUs**:
  - **Description**: These are graphics processing units that you can attach to your EC2 instances to support graphic-intensive applications such as machine learning, video rendering, etc.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications needing additional GPU capacity for graphics or compute-intensive workloads.

9. **Elastic Inference**:
  - **Description**: Allows you to attach low-cost GPU-powered inference acceleration to your EC2 instances, saving on overall costs while running machine learning inference workloads.
  - **Use Case**: Cost-effective for running ML models in production environments.

10. **Capacity Reservation**:
  - **Description**: Capacity Reservations allow you to reserve capacity for EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone. Unlike Reserved Instances, which offer a discount in exchange for a commitment, Capacity Reservations ensure that you have the necessary compute capacity available when you need it. The instances are billed at On-Demand rates.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for workloads that require guaranteed compute capacity in a specific region or Availability Zone, especially for applications that cannot be interrupted, such as critical applications or large-scale migrations.

---

**Spot Fleet**
- **Description**: Spot Fleet is a service that allows you to manage and request a fleet of Spot Instances (and optionally On-Demand Instances) to meet your compute requirements. Spot Fleet provides automated scaling, instance diversification, and fault tolerance to handle instance interruptions.
- **Use Case**: Perfect for large-scale, stateless, batch-processing workloads or any distributed application that can handle interruptions. It allows you to optimize cost and reliability by distributing the fleet across multiple instance types and regions.

- IPv4 costs: Configure IPAM for getting usage insights

### *Elastic IP*
- Restart of a instance changes its public ip 
- Is a public IP you own as long as you don't delete it.
- Could be mapped rapidly to another instance to mask the failure of an instance
- 5 elastic IPs per account
- Not good practice. Alternatives
  - Try to use random public IP and register a DNS name to it
  - Use load balancer (best option)

[elastic-ip-allocation.gif](media/elastic-ip-allocation.gif)

### *EC2 placement groups*
When you launch your EC2 instances, EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all the instances are spread out across the underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures.
To influence this, use placement group
- It is free of cost
- Used to cluster instances. Strategies for the group:
  - *Cluster*: clusters instances into a low latency group in a single AZ, thus high network performance for use cases like HPC (tightly coupled node-to-node communication). 
  - *Spread*: spread instances across underlying hardware ( max 7 instances per group per AZ)
  - *Partition*: spread instances across different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)

![placement-groups.png](media/placement-groups.png)

### Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
- Logical component in VPC representing virtual network card (Eth0, Eth1):
- ENI attributes:
  - Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
  - One elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
  - One public IPv4
  - Security group(s)
  - A MAC address
  - ENI can be created independently and attached on the fly (moved) on EC instances for failover
  - ENI is **bound** to a specific AZ
  - elastic: created, attached on-fly, and while an instance is running
- Use case:
  - instead of creating two instances in two subnets, one creates two ENI in two subnets and attach them to the same instance
  - See more [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-elastic-network-interfaces-in-the-virtual-private-cloud/)

### EC2 instance Hibernate:
- Whatever in RAM is preserved
- It boots much faster (OS not stopped/restarted)
- Under the hood: RAM is written to a file in EBS volume
- Conditions
  - EC2 RAM less than 150GB
  - Volume of type EBS
  - EBS volume must be encrypted
- Use cases:
- Upto 60 days hibernate
- Demo: 
  - create instance --> in 'Advanced Details' set *Stop - Hibernate behavior* to 'enabled'
  - Make sure in the 'configure storage', the volume's encryption is set 'encrypted'
  - Connect to the instance and use 'uptime' command, then hibernate and start again and check the uptime. (should be increasing & not from start from 0)

### EC2 Instance Storage - EBS
- EBS (Elastic Block Store)
  - Now, every computer needs storage, right? EBS is the hard drive for your EC2 instance.
  - It's like an external SSD or HDD attached to your cloud computer where you can store your files, databases, or any data your application uses.
  - The best part? Even if your EC2 instance is stopped or deleted, the EBS can keep your data safe unless you choose to delete it
  - It is a network drive (network usb stick to say). Uses network to communicate with instances
  - Plug and play
  - Mounted to one instance at a time
  - bound to an AZ
    - To move to another AZ, create the snapshot
  - It is provisioned capacity, which means determining in advance:
    - size in GBs
    - Throughput
    - IO spead in IOPS (I/0 per second)
  - Provisioned capacity:
    - billed for all provisioned capacity
    - can be increased overtime

**EBS Snapshots**
- Backup of an EBS at anytime
- Recommended to first detach
- Can copy across AZ or Regions
-  AWS typically initializes the volume lazily. This means that the first time you read a block of data from the new volume, the block must be fetched from Amazon S3 (where snapshots are stored)
- Features:
  - EBS snapshot archive: 
    - Move this archive tier. 
    - 75% cheaper
    - takes 24 to 72 hours to restored
  - Recycle Bin for EBS snapshots
    - to recover after deletion
    - retention period of (1 day to 1 year)
  - Fast snapshot restore (FSR)
    - costs a lot more
    - FSR eliminates above lazy latency by pre-warming the volume so that all blocks are immediately available upon creation. This ensures the restored volume performs at full speed right from the start.

![ebs-volume-snapshots.png](media/ebs-volume-snapshots.png)
- Snapshot Demo:

[snapshot-demo.gif](media/snapshot-demo.gif)

**EBS Encryption**
- Encrypted EBS volumes, means encryption of:
  - data at rest
  - in flight data between instance and volume
  - snapshots encrypted
  - volumes created from snapshots
- It leverages key from KMS (AES-256)
- Minimal impact on latency
- Copying unencrypted snapshot allows encryption
- **Issue**: encrypt unencrypted EBS volume?
  - Create EBS snapshot of the volume --> encrypt the EBS snapshot while copying --> create new EBS volume from snapshot (it will be encrypted) --> attach it to the original instance
  - Or shortcut: create a volume from unencrypted snapshot and enable encrypted during the process

### EC2 AMI
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
  - Public AMIs
  - AWS marketplace AMI
  - Custom (own) AMI
- AMIs are built for specific AWS region only.
- AMIs are customization of an EC2 instance
  - add your own software, config, os, monitoring etc
  - AMI built for only one region but can be copied across regions
- AMI creation process: 

![ami-creation-process.png](media/ami-creation-process.png)
- Demos
  - [ami-demo-1.gif](media/ami-demo-1.gif)
  - [ami-demo-2.gif](media/ami-demo-2.gif)

### EC2 Instance Store
- In need of high performance hardware disk:
  - EC2 Instance Store
    - Direct connect instead of over the network
    - Better I/O compared to EBS
    - However, they are ephemeral (lost when instance is stopped)
  - IOPS as high as 310,000 or more (high IO database use cases)
  - Use cases:
    - Buffer, cache, scratch data, temporary content
  - Risk of loss:
    - Backup & replication are your responsibilities

![instance-store.png](media/instance-store.png)

### AWS EFS - Elastic File System
**EFS (Elastic File System)** is a scalable, cloud-based file storage service provided by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It allows multiple **EC2 instances** to access a **shared file system** over the **NFS (Network File System)** protocol, making it ideal for use cases that require shared data access, like web servers or big data applications.

**Key features:**
- **Fully managed and scalable** (automatically grows/shrinks as needed)
- **Accessible from multiple instances** across Availability Zones
- **Pay-as-you-go** pricing
- **Supports encryption** and lifecycle management

![elastic-file-system-efs.png](media/elastic-file-system-efs.png)

- EFS vs EBS vs Instance Store
  - EFS
    - one instance (except io1/io2 - multi-az), locked to one AZ (can be migrated to another AZ using snapshotting technques)
    - gp2: I/O increases if disk size increases
    - gp3 & IO1: can increase IO independent of size
    - Root terminated by default
  - EFS Creation Demo:
  
[efs-creation-demo.gif](media/efs-creation-demo.gif)
  - EBS:
    - Mounting 100s of instances across AZs
    - Linux system only
  - Instance Store:
    - It is physically attached to EC2 instance. If instance lost, storage is lost

### High availability and scalability
- Scalability 
  - Vertically i.e moving from t2.micro to t2.large
    - i.e common for non-distributed systems i.e databases, RDS, ElasticCache etc
  - Horizontal: increase the number of instances
    - for distributed systems i.e web application, modern applications
- High availability: means having apps running in to data centers (== AZs)
  - goal is to survive a data center loss
  - Enabled with:
    - Auto scaling group multi-AZ
    - Load Balancer multi AZ

## ELB - AWS managed Load Balancer
- Expose a single point of entry (DNS) to the app
- Seamlessly handle failure of downstream instance
- Does regular health check of the instances
- SSL termination (HTTPS)
- ELB is Multi-AZ and doesn't work across regions
- Enforce stickiness to cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private one
- Well integrated with other AWS services and ease of integration
  - EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Amazon ECS
  - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), Route 53, WAF, AWS global accelerator. 

![elastic-load-balancer.png](media/elastic-load-balancer.png)

- Security consideration
  - EC2 accepts incoming traffic only from SG that is assigned to LB on port 80
  - While LB accepts HTTP and HTTPS from everyone on port 80
- ELB Types: Classic, Application LB, Network LB, Gateway LB
### **Classic:** (Old) - 2009
### **Application LB:** HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket - 2016: Layer 7 only LB 
- LB to multiple HTTP apps across machines (target groups)
- LB to multiple applications on the same machine (i.e containers)
- It has only static DNS name and not static IP. Only NLB has static IP
- supports redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
- Routing:
  - routing based on path (content-based routing) (example.com/user & example.com/post routed to two different target groups)
  - routing based on hostname (one.example.com & other.example.com two routs routed to two different target groups)
  - Routing based on query string, headers
- ALB are great fit for microservices and container-based application (docker, AWS ECS)
    
  ![type-application-load-balancer.png](media/type-application-load-balancer.png)
- ALB and Subnets
  - EC2 instances (target group) are in private subnet (?)
  - add public subnets on the same AZ as the private ones to ALB

![alb-private-public-subnets.webp](media/alb-private-public-subnets.webp)
- Target groups of ALB
  - EC2 instances (can be managed by auto-scaling group) - HTTP
  - ECS tasks - HTTP
  - Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
  - IP addresses (private IPs)
  - ALB can route to multiple target groups
    
  ![alb-multiple-targets.png](media/alb-multiple-targets.png)
- Health check are at the target group level
- It has a fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
- Application servers don't see the IP of the client directly (the true IP is inserted into the header `X-Forwarded-For`), as well as the port (`X-Forwarded-Port`) and protocol (`X-Forwarded-Proto`)

  - [alb-rule-setup-demo.gif](media/alb-rule-setup-demo.gif)
    
### **Network LB:** TCP, TLS (secure TLS), UDP - 2017. 
- A layer 4 LB, High Performance (millions of requests per seconds)
- Forwards TCP & UDP traffic to the instances
- Ultra-low latency
- It has one static IP per AZ (can use an elastic IP for this purpose) - whitelisting specific IPs
- Not included in free tier
- Use case: app needs to be access through specific IPs, --> then use NLB
- Target group:
  - EC2 instances
  - Private IPs (own or EC2)
  - Another ALB: NLB --> ALB, getting benefits of both
- `Health check`: TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS
- NLB Setup Demo
  - [nlb-demo.gif](media/nlb-demo.gif)
    
### **Gateway LB:** operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP protocol
- Deploy, scale and manage a fleet if 3rd party network virtual appliances i.e Firewalls, Intrusion detection & Prevention Systems, Deep packet inspection system, payload manipulation
- Layer 3 LB (IP layer)
- Functions:
  - transparent network gateway: single entry/exit for all traffic
  - Load balancer: across virtual appliances
- Target group:
  - EC2 instances
  - Ip addresses (must be private IPs) of both own and aws resources
- Uses `GENEVE` protocol on port `6081
    
  ![gateway-load-balancer.png](media/gateway-load-balancer.png)
- LB can be setup as private or public
### **Sticky Sessions:**
- stickiness: same client redirected to the same instance behind LB
- How it works: cookie is sent as part of client request that has expiration date
- Usecase: make sure the use doesn't lose his session data (such as user's login data)
- may bring imbalance
- Types:
  - application-based
    - Custom cookie
      - generated by the target
      - can include any custom attribute
      - Can't have AWSALB, AWSALBAPP or AWSALBTG
    - application cookie
      - generated by load balancer
      - name is AWSALBAPP
  - duration-based:
    - generated by LB
    - name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB
- Sticky Session Demo on ALB
  - [sticky-session-demo-alb.gif](media/sticky-session-demo-alb.gif)
### Cross-Zone LB:
  - In ALB, it is enabled by default. It can be disabled at `target group` level. No charges for inter AZs traffic (which costs normally)
  - Change it in `target group` under `attributes` section.
  - In NLB, GLB, it is disabled by default. If activated, it costs for inter AZs traffic. Can be changed in LB attributes section directly

![cross-zone-load-balances.png](media/cross-zone-load-balances.png)
### SSL/TLS:
- SSL certificate allows traffic between your client and LB to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
- SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, used to encrypt connections
- TLS refers to Transport Layer Security, the newer version of SSL
- TLS certificates are mainly used, though people still refers to  it as SSL
- SSL certs are issued by Certificate Authority (CA) i.e Comodo, GoDaddy etc
- Has expiration date

![SSL-termination.png](media/SSL-termination.png)
- SSL SNI:
  - Problem: Loading multiple SSL certs onto one server (to serve multiple websites)
  - Server will find the correct cert or return the default
  - Only works with ALB & NLB, CloudFront
  
  ![server-name-indication.png](media/server-name-indication.png)
    
- SSL Setup Demo:
  - [ssl-alb-nlb-setup.gif](media/ssl-alb-nlb-setup.gif)

### Connection draining:
  - in CLB, called Connection draining
  - in ALB, NLB called De-registering Delay
  - it is time to complete "in-flight requests' while the instance is de-registering or is unhealthy
  - it is between 1 and 3600 (default 300)

## Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- horizontally scaling the number of instances up and down
- scale up vs scale out??
- ensures max and min number of instances at any time
- terminate unhealthy and bring up new ones
- automatically register the new one to LB
- Launch Template:
  - AMI + instance type
  - EC2 User Data
  - EBS Volumes
  - Security Groups
  - SSH Key Pair
  - IAM Role for EC2 instances
  - Network + Subnet Information
  - LB Info
  - Demo:
    - [auto-scaling-demo.gif](media/auto-scaling-demo.gif)
  - Auto Scaling Group Adjustment Demo
    - [auto-scaling-group-adjustment-demo.gif](media/auto-scaling-group-adjustment-demo.gif)
- Scaling Policies
  - Dynamic Scaling
    - Target tracking scaling
      - easy to setup i.e I want the average CPU usage in ASG to stay at 40%
    - Simple / Step Scaling
      - when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered (i.e CPU > 70%), then add 2 units
  - Scheduled Scaling
    - i.e increase the min capacity to 10 at 5pm on Fridays
  - Predictive Scaling: continuously forecast load and schedule scaling ahead. ML driven
    - Analyze historical data --> generate forecast --> schedule scaling actions
- Good Metrics:
  - CPUUtilization: Average CPU usage across all EC2 instances
  - RequestCountPerTarget
  - Average Network IN/OUT
  - Custom metrics
- Scaling Cooldowns
  - after scaling activities happens, it goes into cooldown period (default 300 seconds)
  - during this period no terminate or launch happens
---

üîπ **Default Termination Policy (How instances are chosen for termination):**

When Auto Scaling needs to terminate an instance (e.g., during scale-in), it follows this **order**:

1. **AZ Balance**:  
   Tries to **keep Availability Zones balanced** by choosing the AZ with the **most instances**.

2. **Oldest Launch Template**:  
   Within that AZ, it picks instances **launched with the oldest template** unless there is an instance that uses launch configuration.

3. **Oldest Instance**:  
   If multiple instances use the same config, it terminates the **oldest EC2 instance**.
4. The one closest to the next billing hour

5. **Random Choice**:  
   If there's still a tie, it **randomly picks** one.

---

 ‚úÖ **Why this matters**
- Helps maintain **AZ balance** (for high availability).
- Encourages rotation of **older instances**.
- Ensures **consistent configuration** by phasing out outdated launch setups.

## AWS Route 53
Route 53 is a **highly available (100% SLA), scalable, and reliable** ** authoritative DNS (Domain Name System) service** by AWS.
Authoritative means the use can update the DNS records.
Think of **AWS Route 53** as a **phonebook for the internet** üìñüìû. It helps users connect domain names (like `example.com`) to actual web servers (like `192.168.1.1`). 
Basically it translates human-friendly hostnames into the machine IP addresses (this is DNS - domain name service). DNS uses hierarchical naming structure:


### **Understanding DNS Hierarchical Naming Structure**
DNS (**Domain Name System**) is like the **internet‚Äôs phonebook**, translating human-friendly names (like `www.example.com`) into machine-friendly IP addresses (`192.168.1.1`).

DNS follows a **hierarchical naming structure**, where each part of a domain name represents a different level in the hierarchy. Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Root Domain (`.`)**
- The top-most level in DNS, though it is usually **invisible** in URLs.
- Represented by a single `.` (dot) at the end (`example.com.`).
- Managed by **Root Name Servers** (operated by ICANN & others).
- Root servers direct queries to **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)** like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`.

‚úÖ **Example**: A request for `www.example.com` first checks the **root DNS servers** to find `.com` servers.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Top-Level Domain (TLD) (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.edu`)**
- The next level below the root.
- Common types of TLDs:
  - **Generic TLDs (gTLDs)** ‚Üí `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.info`
  - **Country Code TLDs (ccTLDs)** ‚Üí `.us`, `.uk`, `.in`, `.de`
  - **Sponsored TLDs (sTLDs)** ‚Üí `.edu`, `.gov`, `.mil`

‚úÖ **Example**: The `.com` registry manages all `.com` domains and directs requests for `example.com` to the next level.

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Second-Level Domain (SLD) (`example.com`)**
- The main part of a domain name.
- Registered with a domain registrar (e.g., AWS Route 53, GoDaddy, Namecheap).
- Can have multiple **subdomains**.

‚úÖ **Example**: `example.com` is the **SLD**, owned by a business or person.

---

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Subdomains (`www.example.com`, `api.example.com`)**
Subdomains are **prefixes added to the main domain** to organize different sections of a website.

| **Subdomain** | **Purpose** |
|--------------|------------|
| **www.example.com** | Standard web traffic (main website) |
| **api.example.com** | API services (backend services) |
| **blog.example.com** | Blog or separate content section |
| **mail.example.com** | Email servers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) |

‚úÖ **Example**:
- `www.example.com` ‚Üí Main website
- `api.example.com` ‚Üí API server for developers
- This means that `api.www.example.com` is a subdomain of `www.example.com`, which is itself a subdomain of example.com.
---

### **Summary: Hierarchical Breakdown**
```
www.example.com.
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Subdomain (www)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Second-Level Domain (example)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Top-Level Domain (TLD - .com)
```
- Queries start at the **root (`.`)**.
- The **TLD (`.com`)** directs to the right domain registrar.
- The **SLD (`example.com`)** directs to the specific domain owner‚Äôs DNS.
- The **Subdomain (`www, api`)** directs to different services or servers.
---

### **DNS Records Explained (A, AAAA, CNAME & More)**
DNS (**Domain Name System**) records are **instructions stored in a DNS server** that help map domain names to IP addresses or other services.

Each record type serves a different purpose. Let‚Äôs break them down:


**Summary Table**

| **Record Type** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **A** | Maps a domain to an IPv4 address | `example.com ‚Üí 192.168.1.1` |
| **AAAA** | Maps a domain to an IPv6 address | `example.com ‚Üí 2001:db8::1` |
| **CNAME** | Creates an alias to another domain | `www.example.com ‚Üí example.com` |
| **MX** | Routes email traffic to mail servers | `example.com ‚Üí mail.google.com` |
| **TXT** | Stores text info for verification/security | `example.com ‚Üí SPF/DKIM record` |
| **NS** | Points to authoritative name servers | `example.com ‚Üí ns1.awsdns.com` |
| **PTR** | Reverse lookup (IP ‚Üí domain) | `192.168.1.1 ‚Üí example.com` |
| **SRV** | Defines service endpoints | `_sip._tcp.example.com ‚Üí sip.example.com` |

### **Key Features of AWS Route 53**
- Domain Registration (Buy a Domain)
  - You can buy and manage domain names (`example.com`) directly from AWS.
  - Supports common domains like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, and country-specific domains.
  
- Route 53 helps route internet traffic by mapping domain names to:
  - AWS services (EC2, S3, CloudFront, etc.)
  - External servers
  - Load balancers (for handling traffic smoothly)
- Route 53 Records contains:
  - domain, subdomain
  - record type i.e A, AAAA
  - value i.e 112.34.44.54
  - routing policy: how route 53 responds to queries
  - TTL
- How Does Route 53 Use These Records?
  - **A (IPv4)/AAAA(IPv6)** records ‚Üí Point domains to AWS EC2, ALB, CloudFront, or S3.
  - **CNAME** ‚Üí Used for **CloudFront** or subdomain redirection. i.e `demo-route-53-1859546283.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com` to `myapp.mydomain.com`
  - **NS** ‚Üí Used when delegating domain management to Route 53.
  - **MX/TXT** ‚Üí Configured for AWS SES (email services).
- CNAME can't be created for the top node (i.e example.com)
- Route 53 Alias:
  - `app.mydomain.com` --> `blbbla.amazonaws.com`
  - unlike CNAME, it works for root domain (Zone Apex) as well (`mydomain.com` --> `demo-route-53-1859546283.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com`)
  - free
  - health check 
  - maps only to AWS resources
  - its record type is always A/AAAA
  - No TTL
  - It automatically recognizes changes in aws resource's IP address
  - Targets:
    - ELB
    - CloudFront
    - API Gateway
    - Elastic Beanstalk
    - S3 Websites
    - VPC endpoints
    - global accelerator accelerator 
    - Route 53 record in the same hosted zone
    - Alias target can't be an EC2 DNS name
  - 

- Route 53 Hosted Zones
  - We pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone
  - public hosted zones:
    - records for how to route the traffic on the internet i.e app1.myapp.com
  - private hosted zones:
    - records for how to route the traffic within one or more VPCs i.e app1.company.internal
   
   ![private-hosted-zone-53.png](media/private-hosted-zone-53.png)

- Health Checks (Monitor Website Status)
  - **Route 53 can check if your website/server is up**.
  - If a server is **down**, it can **automatically redirect traffic** to another healthy server.
- Integration with AWS Services
  - Works seamlessly with **EC2, S3, CloudFront, and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.
  - Can route traffic to **multi-region and multi-cloud architectures**.
- Route 53 TTL
  - Under the record we have TTL
  - high TTL `24 hours`
    - less traffic of route 53 (less costs)
    - possibly outdated records
  - low TTL `60 seconds`
    - more traffic on route 53 ($$)
    - easy to change records (updated records)
  - Except for Alias records (CNAME), TTL is mandatory for each DNS record
---

### Route 53 Demos
- For demos, see folder `not-public-demos`
  - Register a domain example.com. see `route-53-domain-register.gif`
  - A hosted zone will be created correspondingly. In it, we create DNS records. see `hosted-zone-record-demo.gif`
  - create three EC2 instances in three regions (i.e frankfurt, N. Virginia, Singapore) having a web server added in UserData section (see `route-53-user-data.sh`)
    - select ssh and http under new security group
  - create an ALB in one region (frankfurt), internet facing

### Routing Policies (Control How Traffic is Directed)
AWS Route 53 has several routing policies to **control how users reach your website**:

| **Routing Policy** | **How It Works**                                                                | **Use Case** |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Simple Routing** | Maps a domain to a single IP                                                    | Basic websites |
| **Weighted Routing** | Distributes traffic based on weights (e.g., 70% to one server, 30% to another)  | A/B testing, traffic distribution |
| **Latency-Based Routing** | Directs users to the closest, fastest AWS region (to lowest latency location)   | Global apps needing fast response time |
| **Failover Routing** | Automatically switches to a backup server if the primary one fails              | High availability, disaster recovery |
| **Geolocation Routing** | Sends users to servers based on their location (e.g., U.S. users ‚Üí U.S. server) | Region-specific content, compliance |
| **Geoproximity Routing** | Similar to Geolocation but allows adjusting traffic bias                        | Fine-tuned location-based routing |
| **Multi-Value Answer Routing** | Returns multiple healthy IP addresses, similar to load balancing                | Distributes traffic across multiple instances |

**Route 53 Health Checks**

Used to enable **automated DNS failover** ‚Äî but **only for public resources** (except when using CloudWatch alarms). There are **three types**:

**1. Endpoint Health Checks**
- Route 53 uses ~15 global health checkers to monitor a **public endpoint** (e.g., ALB, which checks EC2).
- **Default settings:**
  - Interval: 30 seconds
  - Healthy/Unhealthy threshold: 3
  - Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, TCP
  - Healthy if: status code is **2xx or 3xx**
  - Considered healthy if >18% of checkers report healthy
- Make sure your **firewalls/routers allow incoming checks** from [Route 53 health checker IPs](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json) (`ROUTE53_HEALTHCHECKS`)
- **Important:** Health checkers are **outside the VPC**.

---

**2. Calculated Health Checks**
- Combines results of **multiple health checks** (up to 256).
- Use logical rules like **AND, OR, NOT**.
- Useful for creating complex failover logic.

---

**3. Health Checks Using CloudWatch Alarms**
- For **private resources** (inside a VPC).
- Since Route 53 checkers **can‚Äôt access private endpoints**, use a **CloudWatch alarm** as a proxy.
- Steps:
  - Create a CloudWatch **metric & alarm**
  - Create a Route 53 health check that monitors the **alarm state**

![r3-rourting-polic-failover.png](media/r3-rourting-polic-failover.png)
  - Demo:
  
[r53-routing-polic-failover-demo.gif](media/r53-routing-polic-failover-demo.gif)

**Geolocation Routing Policy:**
  - Routing is basd on user's location i.e eu user routed to eu region
  - Use case: website localization, restrictive content distribution, load balancing
  - should have a default record for a location that is not specified
  - Demo:

[r53-routing-polic-geolocation-demo.gif](media/r53-routing-polic-geolocation-demo.gif)

**Geoproximity Routing Policy:**
  - routing based on location `and` resources
  - using `bias` values we shift the traffic accordingly
    - to expand the size of geographic region from which Route53 route traffic to a resource, specify a bias value of int 1 - 99
    - to shrink the size set a value -1 to -99
  - resources can be:
    - AWS resources (specify using AWS region)
    - non-AWS resources (specify latitude & longitude)
  - use route 53 Traffic flow
  - example: 
    1. us-west-1 (Bias = 0) <--  & us-east-1 (Bias = 0) `vs` 
    2. us-west-1 (Bias = 0) & us-east-1 (Bias = 50)
    - in `2` more users will go through us-east-1 because of the weightage.

**IP-based Routing Policy:**
  - Based on users' IP
  - using CIDRs i.e users who have specific CIDR (specific ISP) routed to specific instance
  - use cases: optimize performance, reduce network costs

![r53-ip-based-routing-polic.png](media/r53-ip-based-routing-polic.png)

**Multi-value Routing Policy:**
  - When routing traffic to multiple resources
  - Upto max 8 `healthy records are returned for each MV query
  - It can be associated with Health check (Simple routing multiple value is different as it can not be associated with health check)
  - Route 53 returns multiple values/resources
  - Multi-value is not a substitute for having an ELB. It is indeed a client side load balancing
  - Demo:


**Domain Registrar vs DNS service:**
  - Domain Registrar != DNS Service
  - But most Registrars usually comes with some DNS features
  - Route 53 is a registrar which provides DNS services along side. 
  - We can use third party registrar like GoDaddy with AWS route 53.
  - Steps: 
    - we create a public hosted zone using our domain from GoDaddy 
    - in details find `Name Servers`
    - Go to `GoDaddy` and put those `Name Servers` into the GoDaddy 
- 
### **Why Use Route 53?**
- **Fast & Reliable** ‚Äì AWS infrastructure ensures high uptime.  
- **Scalable** ‚Äì Handles any amount of traffic.  
- **Cost-Effective** ‚Äì Pay only for what you use.  
- **Easy to Use** ‚Äì Simple console interface.  
- **Global DNS Management** ‚Äì Perfect for businesses serving users worldwide.

##AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)
Think of **AWS S3** like an **infinite online hard drive** where you can store and retrieve any kind of file (documents, images, videos, backups, etc.) anytime from anywhere in the world.

- Use cases:
  - Backup and storage
  - Disaster recovery (if a region goes down)
  - Archive:
  - Hybrid Cloud storage
  - Host application
  - host medias
  - Data lake & big data analytics
  - software delivery
  - static website

### Buckets & Objects (Folders & Files)
- Bucket ‚Üí Like a folder that holds files (objects). Each S3 account can have multiple buckets.
  - must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
  - It is defined at the region level only
  - name:
    - no uppercase, no underscore
    - 3 - 63 characters log
    - not an IP
- Object ‚Üí The actual file (data) stored in a bucket, along with metadata.
  - objects have a key - `prefix + object name`
  - the key is the full path i.e _s3://my-bucket/`my_file.txt`_
  - max object size is 5TB. if greater then use `multi-part upload`a
  - Metadata
    - text key/value paris
  - Tags
  - version ID
- It offers strong read-after-write consistency automatically without changes to performance or availabilities

- Demo:

[s3-creation-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-creation-demo.gif)
### Scalability & Durability
- Scalable ‚Üí No storage limits. You can store **terabytes or even petabytes** of data.
- Durable ‚Üí Data is stored **across multiple locations** (99.999999999% durability).

### Security & Access Control
- **Encryption** ‚Üí Data is protected using encryption (both at rest & in transit).
- **Access Control** ‚Üí You can set permissions using:
  - **IAM Policies** ‚Üí Who can access your S3 data. User-based control.
  - **Bucket Policies** ‚Üí Rules for the entire bucket. Resource based control. the most common one.
    - IAM principal access an s3 object if the user's IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it AND there is no explicit DENY
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*", // the account or user to apply policy to
            "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"]
          }
        ]
    }
    ```
    
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** ‚Üí Control specific users' access. Resource based control.

![s3-security-access.png](media/s3/s3-security-access.png)
  - Demo:

[s3-grant-pub-access-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-grant-pub-access-demo.gif)

### Data Versioning & Backup
- **Versioning** ‚Üí Keeps old versions of files. If you overwrite or delete a file, you can restore previous versions.
- Demo: activating versioning

[s3-versioning-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-versioning-demo.gif)
- Demo: restore previous version or delete one
  - [s3-restore-previous-version-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-restore-previous-version-demo.gif)
  - [s3-restore-deleted-obj-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-restore-deleted-obj-demo.gif)

- **Replication** ‚Üí Copies data to another AWS region for disaster recovery.
  - CRR (cross region replication)
  - SRR (same region replication)
- Or use sync command to copy between S3 source and S3 destination
  - `aws s3 sync s3://source-bucket-name s3://destination-bucket-name`

![s3-replicaiton.png](media/s3/s3-replicaiton.png)
    - Demo:

[s3-replication-crr.gif](media/s3/s3-replication-crr.gif)


### Static Website Hosting
- You can host **a simple website** directly from S3 without a web server.
- html and images
- **NOTE**: in order for the setup to work, public access bucket policy should be activated (see `Security & Access Control)

[s3-static-website-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-static-website-demo.gif)

### Event Notifications & Integrations
- Triggers AWS services like **Lambda**, **SNS**, or **SQS** (only standard queue and not FIFO) when files are added or changed.

![s3-event-notification.png](media/s3/s3-event-notification.png)
  - Demo

[s3-sqs-event-notif-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-sqs-event-notif-demo.gif)

### Storage [Classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) (Cost Optimization)
- Durability: 99.9999999999 (11 9's), same for all storage classes
- Availability: 99.99% (means 53 minutes in a year not available)
- AWS offers different **storage classes** based on access frequency and cost:
  - **S3 Standard** ‚Üí 
    - For frequent access, higher cost.
    - low latency & high throughput
    - use cases: Big data analytics, mobile and gaming apps, content distribution
    - 99.99% availability
  - **S3 Standard Infrequent Access (IA)** ‚Üí For data you don‚Äôt use often, lower cost.
    - for data accessed less frequently but requires rapid access (in milliseconds latency)
    - 99.9% availability
    - use cases: DR, backups
  - **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** ‚Üí Automatically moves files between Standard and IA to optimize cost.
  - **S3 One-Zone Infrequent Access (IA)** ‚Üí
    - 11 9's durability in a single AZ
    - 99.5% availability
    - use cases: storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data
    - with expiration deletion option
    - The minimum storage duration is 30 days before you transition objects from S3 standard to S3 One Zone-IA
    - it costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA
  - **S3 Glacier** ‚Üí For long-term archiving, very cheap but slow retrieval.
    - Glacier Instant retrieval: milliseconds retrieval, min 90 days
    - Glacier flexible retrieval: expedited (1 to 5 minutes), standard (3 to 5 hours), bulk (5 to 12 hours). Min storage 90 days
    - Glacier deep archive: long term storage. standard (12 hours), bulk (48 hours). Min storage 180 days
      - 75% less expensive than S3 glacier
   - For archive objects move them to Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
   - Move b/w classes automated using life cycle rules
     - we can set expiration actions (to delete files at a specific time later)
     - automate clean up of old/unfinished parts
     - rules can be applied to a certain prefix  or entire bucket or a specific tags
     - Storage class analysis done by s3 bucket. Analysis is available between 24 to 48 hours. It can be used for optimization of object moves b/w tiers

Waterfall model for transitioning between storage classes:
![s3-storage-class-move.png](media/s3/drafted-s3-storage-class-move.png)

[s3-storage-classes-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-storage-classes-demo.gif)

### Requester Pays
- Storage cost + Network cost --> Paid by the owner
- Storage cost paid by the owner & Network cost paid by requester (downloader)
  - The requester must be authenticated in AWS

### S3 - Baseline Performance
- auto scale to high requests rates, latency 100-200ms
- 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE & 5500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix (path at the tail of object)
- Optimization
  - multi-part uploads recommended for file > 100 MB (from 500MB it is must). it helps parallelize uploads
  - S3 transfer acceleration:
    - increase transfer speed by transferring the file to and AWS edge location which will forward the data to the target region
    - edge location is compatible with multi-part upload

  - S3 Byte-Range Fetches
    - parallelize GETs by requesting specific byte ranges
    - better resilience in case of failure
    - speeds up the download (parts downloaded in parallel)
    - can be useful for partial data request such as file header for some info

![s3-transfer-edge-loc.png](media/s3/s3-transfer-edge-loc.png)

### S3 batch operations
- bulk operation on s3 objects in a single request
- batch modification batch transfer, batch encryption, invoke lambda function to perform custom action on each object
- use S3 inventory to get object list and use athena to query and filter objects

![s3-batch-operation.png](media/s3/s3-batch-operation.png)

### S3 Storage Lens:
- analyze, optimize storage across all AWS orgs
- discover anomalies, identify cost efficiency, apply data protection best practices
- Metrics
  - summary metrics such as size of buckets
  - cost optimization metrics i.e incomplete parts etc
  - data protection metrics: versioning etc to follow data protection practices
  - access management metrics: ownership etc
  - event metrics
  - performance metrics
  - activity metrics
  - http status code metrics i.e 200, 404 etc
- free metrics vs paid metrics

![drafted-s3-storage-lens.png](media/s3/drafted-s3-storage-lens.png)
### S3 Object Encryption:
- Amazon S3 object encryption is a security feature that protects data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) by encrypting objects at rest. It ensures data confidentiality and compliance with security standards. S3 supports multiple encryption methods:
- **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**
  - **SSE-S3**: AWS manages encryption keys automatically. Active by default
    - AES-256, must set header to `"x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256`
  - **SSE-KMS**: Uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for key management and access control.
    - advantage: user control + audit key usage in CloudTrail
    - must set header to `"x-amz-servier-side-encryption":"aws:kms"`
    - to access one should have access to object as well to the KMS key used to encrypt
    - another variant is DSSE-KMS
    - limitation:
      - when you upload it calls GenerateDataKey KMS API & when downloading it calls decrypt
      - KMS quota limit per second (5500, 10000, 30000 req/s based on region)
  - **SSE-C**: Customers provide and manage their own encryption keys.
    - keys managed outside the AWS
    - done from CLI only and not on the console
    - HTTPS must be used and must have key in the header of client's request
- **Client-Side Encryption**
  - Encrypted before sending it to S3
  - two options for key used for encryption
    - customer master key (CMK) stored in aws key management
    - master key stored within the client application
  - Data is encrypted before being uploaded, with key management handled by the client.
- Encryption helps protect sensitive data, meet regulatory requirements, and enhance security in cloud storage.

![s3-encryption.png](media/s3/s3-encryption.png)

![s3-encryption-2.webp](media/s3/s3-encryption-2.webp)
  - Force encryption in transit: `aws:SecureTransport`

![drafted-s3-aws-secure-transport.png](media/s3/drafted-s3-aws-secure-transport.png)

  - Demos:

[s3-encryption-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-encryption-demo.gif)
  
  - refuse any call to S3 without encryption headers using bucket policy
    - bucket policies are evaluated before "Default Encryption"
```

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {

                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

### S3 CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):
  - origin: http(s)://www.example.com (implied port 443 for https or 80 to http)
  - browser based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin
  - same origin requests: http://example.com/path1 & http://example.com/path2
  - cross origin request: http://www.example.com & http://other.example.com.
    - be default it is not allowed to be fulfilled unless the other origin allows it using the CORS header (Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

![s3-and-cors.png](media/s3/s3-and-cors.png)
  
  - client makes a cross-origin request on S3
  - allowed for specific origin or * (for all)

![s3-and-cors-on-bucket.png](media/s3/s3-and-cors-on-bucket.png)

  - Demos:

[s3-cors-demo-1.gif](media/s3/s3-cors-demo-1.gif)

[s3-cors-demo-2.gif](media/s3/s3-cors-demo-2.gif)

### MFA Delete:
- versioning must be active 
- permanently delete an object
- suspend versioning. Versioning can't be disabled once enabled, it can only be suspended
- MFA can be activated only through CLI by using root credentials
- how?
  - to use MFA, root must set up MFA device already
  - create access key for the root (used for creating aws CLI profile)
  - use root CLI profile and activate the MFA
  
  ```
  # generate root access keys
  aws configure --profile root-mfa-bucket-delete-demo
  aws s3 ls --profile root-mfa-bucket-delete-demo
    
  # enable mfa delete
  aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket mfa-demo-bucket-2025 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::727646513157:mfa/Authapp 280449" --profile root-mfa-bucket-delete-demo
    
  # disable mfa delete
  aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket mfa-demo-bucket-2025 --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Disabled --mfa "arn:aws:iam::727646513157:mfa/Authapp 279226" --profile root-mfa-bucket-delete-demo
    
  # delete the root credentials in the IAM console!!!
  ```
  - Demos:

[s3-mfa-activation-cli.gif](media/s3/s3-mfa-activation-cli.gif)

### S3 Access Logs, Object Retention, S3 pre-signed urls
- S3 Access Logs:
  - log all accesses to the S3 by any user
  - logs put into logging bucket (both must be in the same region)
  - never make the app bucket and the log bucket --> it creates a loop (grows exponentially)
  - Demo:
    - [s3-logging-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-logging-demo.gif)
    - [s3-logging-demo-2.gif](media/s3/s3-logging-demo-2.gif)

- S3 Object retention
  - one can set retention period on the object version only (implicitly through bucket default setting or explicitly through `retain until date` parameter)

- S3 pre-signed URLs
  - generate using S3 console, aws cli, sdk
  - has expiration
    - s3 console (up 12 hours)
    - aws cli (default: 3600sec max 168 hours)
  - users given pre-signed URL, will inherit the permission of user who generated it.
  - use case: give access to a private bucket's object temporarily, generate dynamic url, allow a user to upload

[s3-pre-signed-url-demo.gif](media/s3/s3-pre-signed-url-demo.gif)

### S3 Lock
- S3 Glacier Vault Lock:
  - Adopt a WORM (write once, read many) model
  - need a Vault Lock Policy
  - no one can delete, even the admin
  - at bucket level
- S3 Object Lock:
  - blocks an object deletion for a specific amount of time
  - for WORM for a retention period of time
  - versioning must be enabled
  - lock at object level and not at bucket level 
  - Retention mode - Compliance: no one can delete including the admin
  - Retention Mode - Governance: most users can't delete except a few admin user with permission (IAM). retention period can be changed
- Legal Hold: protect the object indefinitely, independent of retention period
  - can be place using IAM permission `s3:PutObjectLegalHold`
  - for legal investigation period

### S3 - Access Point
- to delegate access security management from S3 bucket level to access points maintained outside.
- subsequently we will have simple bucket policy
- access point has:
  - own DNS name (internet origin or VPC origin)
  - access point policy (similar to bucket policy) - manage security at scale

![drafted-s3-access-point.png](media/s3/drafted-s3-access-point.png)

- S3 access point VPC origin
  - there would be 3 policies as shown
  - VPC Endpoint must allow access to S3 access point as well as the corresponding S3 bucket.

![drafted-s3-access-point-vpc-origin.png](media/s3/drafted-s3-access-point-vpc-origin.png)

- S3 lambda Objects
  - AWS functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller
  - this avoids duplicating objects. we keep on bucket and adjust objects on-fly
  - we create s3 access point, s3 lambda object access point as shown

![drafted-s3-access-point-lambda-object.png](media/s3/drafted-s3-access-point-lambda-object.png)
### **Why Use S3?**
- No hardware management  
- Secure & reliable storage  
- Cost-efficient with flexible pricing  
- Works well with other AWS services

## AWS CloudFront
- A fast CDN (Content Delivery Network) that securely delivers data, videos, apps and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds
  - AWS Point of Presence (POP or Edge Location):
    - 400+ PS (400+ Edge locations & 10+ Regional Cache) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
  - improves read performance by caching content at the edge (all around the year) to deliver popular contents quickly
  - aws has [216 point](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/?nc=sn&loc=2&whats-new-cloudfront.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cloudfront.sort-order=desc) of presence ( edge locations)
  - CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers even when the content is not popular enough to stay at POP
- DDoS protection (worldwide shutdown) by Shield and AWS app firewall
- Integration with Cognito User Pool:
  - Can't directly integration with cognito
  - would need an additional Lambda@Edge function to accomplish authentication via Cognito User Pools
### **CloudFront Origins:**
1. S3 bucket
  - to allow only CF to access the bucket:
    - configure a origin access identity (OAI) or Origin Access Control (OAC)
    - setup the permission in AWS S3 bucket policy so that only the OAI can read the objects
  - can use CF as an ingress (to upload to S3)
  - from the demo, pay attention how fast is the second access of the object because of cloudfront caching
  - the file size should be under 1GB. above that use `s3 transfer accelerator` instead

![drafted-cloudfront-high-level.png](media/cloudfront/drafted-cloudfront-high-level.png)

![drafted-cloudfront-s3-origin.png](media/cloudfront/drafted-cloudfront-s3-origin.png)

  - Demo with S3 bucket as origin
    - [cloudfront-setup-demo-1.gif](media/cloudfront/cloudfront-setup-demo-1.gif)
    - [cloudfront-setup-demo-2.gif](media/cloudfront/cloudfront-setup-demo-2.gif)

2. Custom Origin (HTTP)
    - ALB
    - EC2 instance
    - S3 website (static website)
    - any http backend

![drafted-cloudfront-alb-ec2-origin.png](media/cloudfront/drafted-cloudfront-alb-ec2-origin.png)
  - Public IPs of [Edge locations](http://d7uri8nf7uskq.cloudfront.net/tools/list-cloudfront-ips)

- A single CF can serve different types of requests from `multiple origins` i.e serve static content from S3 and dynamic from LB
- Create origins in CF first. Then use these origins to create **origin group**. Set primary and secondary origin for `ha` and `failover`

![cf-origin-groups-overview.png](media/cloudfront/cf-origin-groups-overview.png)

- **Field-level encryption** allows users to securely upload sensitive information.
  - the sensitive info encrypted at the edge
  - to setup, specify the set of fields in POST requests that should be encrypted and the public key to encrypt
  - can encrypt upto 10 data fields in a request

![field-level-encryption.png](media/cloudfront/field-level-encryption.png)
### CF vs S3 Cross Region Replication:
- CloudFront
  - global edge n/w
  - is a CDN
  - files cached for a TTL 
  - great for static content that must be available everywhere
- S3 CRR
  - must be setup explicitly for each region
  - read only
  - great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low latency in few regions

### CF Geo restriction:
- can restrict who can access your distribution
  - Allowlist: countries allowed
  - Blocklist: countries not allowed

[cloudfront-geo-restrictions.gif](media/cloudfront/cloudfront-geo-restrictions.gif)

### CF pricing:
  - based on geographical location the price of data out per edge differs
  - to do cost reduction, reduce the number of edge locations
  - 3 price classes
    - Price class all
    - price class 200
    - price class 100: USA, Canada, Europe, & Israel

### CF cache invalidation
  - if TTL not expired and backend changes, it still show old version
  - invalidation of cache bypasses the TTL
  - invalidate all (*) or part (/images/*)

![cloudfront-invalidate-cache.png](media/cloudfront/cloudfront-invalidate-cache.png)

## AWS global accelerator
- It is networking service that sends user's traffic through aws global network infrastructure

![aws-global-accelerator.jpg](media/global-accelerator/aws-global-accelerator.jpg)
- a lot of latency for global users due to many hops
- Unicast IP vs Anycast IP (all server hold the same IP). A client will be sent to the closest one
- AWS global accelerator
  - leverages AWS internal n/w to route to your application
  - 2 Anycast IPs are created for your application. They are global. They will send the traffic to the closest edge location 
  - work with elastic IPs, EC2, ALB, NLB, public or private

![aws-global-accelerator.png](media/global-accelerator/aws-global-accelerator.png)

![global-accelerator.webp](media/global-accelerator/global-accelerator.webp)
- consistent performance:
  - intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
  - no issue with client cache
  - internal aws n/w
- health check:
  - GA performs a health check of your application
- security:
  - only two IPs needed to be whitelisted
  - DDoS protection

- GA vs CloudFront:
  - They both make use of AWS global n/w and edge locations around the world
  - both integrates with AWS shield for DDoS protection
  - CloudFront:
    - improve performance for both cacheable content
    - dynamic content (such as API acceleration & dynamic site delivery)
    - content served at edge
  - GA 
    - improve performance for a wide range of apps over TCP and UDP
    - no cache
      - proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS regions
      - real-time API such as shipping tracking systems which shouldn't have caching and be real-time
    - It uses endpoint weights to determine proportion of traffic that is directed to the endpoint
    - Blue-green deployment
    - good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
    - good for HTTP use cases that requires static IP addresses
- pricing:
  - fix price and

## AWS advanced storage
### AWS snow family

AWS **Snowball**, **Snowcone**, and **Snowmobile** are all part of AWS's **Snow Family**, designed for edge computing and transferring large amounts of data into or out of AWS, especially when network bandwidth is limited or unreliable. Here's a quick breakdown of how they differ:

- data transfer challenges
  - i.e 10 TB with 100 Mbps speed, takes 12 days to transfer
  - loss connection
  - high network costs
- solution to this is snowball solution

---

### üîπ **AWS Snowcone**
- **Smallest** and most portable of the three.
- **Size:** About the size of a tissue box (4.5 lbs).
- **Storage:** 8 TB of usable storage (HDD or SSD).
- **Use Cases:**
  - Small edge locations
  - IoT data collection
  - Remote or rugged environments
- **Power:** Can run on AC power or battery.
- **Network:** USB-C and Ethernet
- See [AWS DataSync](#aws-datasync) for special use of snowcone
**Best for:** Lightweight edge computing and data transfer from tight or mobile locations.

---

### üîπ **AWS Snowball**
- AWS snowball is highly-secured, portable devices to collect and process data at edge & migrate data into and out of AWS
- **Mid-sized** option ‚Äî comes in two types:
  1. **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized**
    - 40 vCPU, 80 TB usable storage (HDD)
    - Good for large-scale data migrations.
  2. **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized**
    - 42 TB usable storage + 52 vCPUs & GPU option
    - Useful for local compute + transfer (e.g. video analysis, ML inference)

- **Use Cases:**
  - Data transfer at scale
  - Edge computing with AWS services
  - Disaster recovery

**Best for:** Larger on-site data processing and scalable data transfer.

![aws-snowball-storage.png](media/advanced-storage/aws-snowball-storage.png)

- Both can be rack mounted and clustered together to build larger installation (`storage clustering`). Other snow family doesn't support storage clustering.
- Edge computing/storage use case
  - process data while being generated on the edge location i.e underground without internet, ships, truck etc
  - limited access to internet or power
  - with snowball edge we can compute, run EC2 instances or Lambda at the edge
  - use case:
    - preprocessing data, ML, transcode media
- Snowball into Glacier:
  - we can't import directly to S3 glacier storage, instead:

![aws-snowball-2-glacier.png](media/advanced-storage/aws-snowball-2-glacier.png)
- Snowball Demos:

[aws-snowball-demo.gif](media/advanced-storage/aws-snowball-demo.gif)

### üîπ **AWS Snowmobile**
- **Massive scale** data transfer ‚Äî literally a **shipping container on a truck**.
- **Size:** 45-foot ruggedized container.
- **Storage:** Up to **100 PB**.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Huge data center migrations
  - Genomics, video libraries, or large-scale backups

**Best for:** Petabyte-scale data transfer (think exabytes over time), where network is infeasible.

---

### TL;DR ‚Äì Quick Comparison

| Feature               | Snowcone         | Snowball Edge        | Snowmobile        |
|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **Storage Capacity**  | 8 TB             | 42‚Äì80 TB              | Up to 100 PB      |

### AWS Storage Gateway
- S3 is a proprietary storage technology (unlike EFS / NFS), so how to expose the S3 data on-premises?
  - AWS Storage Gateway!
- AWS storage cloud native options

![drafted-aws-native-storages.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-native-storages.png)
- AWS Storage Gateway is a bridge between on-premise data and cloud data
- usages:
  - DR of on-premise data
  - backup and restore of on-premise data for cloud migration
  - tiered storage (extend storage from on-premise to the cloud)
  - or have aws as main storage and use storage gateway for on-premise cache for low latency file access
- AWS storage gateway provides 3 types of storage interfaces for on-premise apps:
  - File Gateway
    - S3 File GW
    - FSx File GW
  - Volume GW
  - Tape GW
- AWS File GW
  - most recently used data is cached in the GW
  - bucket access using IAM roles for each file GW
  - SMB protocol has integration with active directory (AD) for use auth

![drafted-aws-file-s3-gw.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-file-s3-gw.png)

- FSx File GW
  - deprecated
- Volume GW
  - block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
  - backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premise volumes
  - cached volumes at GW
  - stored volumes: dataset is on-premise, while scheduled backups to S3
  - goal of volume GW is to back up your on-premise servers volumes

![drafted-aws-volume-gw.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-volume-gw.png)

- Tape GW
  - Allows replacing physical tapes on-premise with virtual tapes in AWS without changing existing backup workflows
  - Tape gateway encrypt data between the gateway and the AWS for secure data transfer and compresses data while transitioning tapes between S3 and S3 glacier or S3 glacier deep archive

![drafted-aws-tape-gw.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-tape-gw.png)
![tape-gateway.jpg](media/advanced-storage/tape-gateway.jpg)

- Storage Gateway - Hardware Appliance
  - in all the above scenarios, one has to install the GW on-premise
  - if virtual servers are not available on-premise, or from AWS `Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance`
- Summary

![aws-storage-gateway-summary.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-storage-gateway-summary.png)

### AWS DataSync
- Move large amount of data to and from
  - On-premises / other cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API...) ‚Äì it needs agent 
  - AWS to AWS (different storage services) ‚Äì it doesn't need agent
- Can synchronize to:
  - Amazon S3 (any storage classes ‚Äì including Glacier)
  - Amazon EFS
  - Amazon FSx (Windows, Lustre, NetApp, OpenZFS...)
- Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly. It is not continuous
- File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB...)
- One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup a bandwidth limit
- Agent should be installed on the on-premise. If we don't have n/w capacity --> `AWS snowcone`

![drafted-aws-datasync.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-datasync.png)
![drafted-aws-datasync-internal.png](media/advanced-storage/drafted-aws-datasync-internal.png)

### Storage comparison

- Database: for specific workloads, usually with indexing and querying

## AWS Integration and Messaging - decoupling applications: SQS, SNS, Kinesis, Active MQ
- communication patterns:

![application-coupling.png](media/messaging/application-coupling.png)
- to avoid overwhelming the other service, decoupling can be done:
  - SQS: queue model
  - SNS: pub/sub model 
  - Kinesis: real-time streaming model i.e big data
- scaling of services are then independent

### AWS SQS ‚Äì Standard Queue

- Fully Managed & Reliable:
  - Over 10 years in service
- Decouples Applications:
  - Enables scalable, asynchronous processing
- High Throughput:
  - Unlimited messages 
  - low latency (<10ms)
- Message Retention:
  - 4 days (default), up to 14 days max
- Message Size Limit:
  - 256KB per message
- At-Least-Once Delivery
  - Possible **duplicate messages**. That should be taken into account when developing the app.
- Best-Effort Ordering:
  - Messages **may arrive out of order**
- Offers buffer capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency
 **Ideal for** scalable, fault-tolerant messaging where occasional duplicates & out-of-order delivery are acceptable.
- Multiple consumers:
  - each consumer will receive a different set of messages
- Producing message:
  - Messages sent via SDK (SendMessage API)
  - Persisted until consumed & deleted by consumer
- Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of the new messages to a queue for several seconds
  - this gives the consumer time 
  - default(minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds and max is 15 minutes
    ![sqs-delay-queues-diagram.png](media/messaging/sqs-delay-queues-diagram.png)


![aws-sqs.png](media/messaging/aws-sqs.png)

- Amazon SQS ‚Äì Security Overview
  - **Encryption:**
    - **In-Flight:** HTTPS API
    - **At-Rest:** KMS encryption
    - **Client-Side:** Custom encryption option

  - **Access Control:**
    - IAM policies for API access
    - SQS access policies for **cross-account & service integration** (e.g., SNS, S3)
- SQS Message Visibility Timeout
  - Polled messages become invisible to other consumers.
  - Default **visibility timeout**: **30 seconds**.
  - If not processed in time, it becomes visible again and may be **reprocessed**.
  - **ChangeMessageVisibility API** extends timeout if needed.
  - **High timeout** delays retries if a consumer crashes.
  - **Low timeout** increases duplicate processing.

![sqs-message-visibility-timeout.png](media/messaging/sqs-message-visibility-timeout.png)

- SQS Long Polling
  - By default the queue has short polling
    - with short polling, SQS sends the response right away even if the query found no message.
  - With long-polling, sqs send the response only after it collects at least one message, upto a max message specified in the request
    - reduces API calls, and thus costs
  - **Long Polling** allows consumers to **wait** for messages if none are in the queue.
  - **Reduces API calls**, improves efficiency, and lowers latency.
  - Wait time: **1 to 20 seconds** (**20 sec recommended**).
  - **Preferred over Short Polling** for better performance.
  - Can be enabled at the **queue level** or via API using **WaitTimeSeconds**.

![sqs-long-polling.png](media/messaging/sqs-long-polling.png)
- FIFO Queue
  - it has limited throughput because of ordering
  - Ordering by message group ID (all message in the same group are ordered) - mandatory parameter
  - Group Id is comparable to a partition ID
  - to allow multiple consumers, we use group ID
  - Each group could be related to a single producer
  - in KDS, a shard will process one producer
  - Name must end with `.fifo`
  - Because of ordering it supports `300msg/s`
  - with batching (max. batching 10 message per operation), it can reach max of `3000msg/s

![aws-sqs-additional.png](media/messaging/aws-sqs-additional.png)

- Demos:
  - creating SQS

[aws-sqs-demo.gif](media/messaging/aws-sqs-demo.gif)
  - visibility timeout

[aws-sqs-visibility-t-demo.gif](media/messaging/aws-sqs-visibility-t-demo.gif)
  - FIFO demo

[aws-sqs-fifo-demo.gif](media/messaging/aws-sqs-fifo-demo.gif)
- Queue types in SQS:
  - Standard
  - FIFO
  - dead-letter-queue
  - delay queues
  - Temporary queues:
    - concept of a temporary queue usually refers to a short-lived, on-demand queue that is:
      - Created dynamically 
      - Used for a short period 
      - Deleted after use
    - This pattern is often used in request-reply architectures or asynchronous RPC-style communication, especially when clients need a unique queue for responses.

![temporary-queues-in-sqs.png](media/messaging/temporary-queues-in-sqs.png)
### AWS SNS
- What if we want to send one message to many receivers? 
  - AWS SNS

- **Amazon SNS ‚Äì How to Publish**
  - **Topic Publish (SDK):**
    1. **Create a topic**
    2. **Create subscriptions** (one or more)
    3. **Publish to the topic**

  - **Direct Publish (for mobile apps):**
    - **Create a platform application**
    - **Create a platform endpoint**
    - **Publish to the endpoint**
    - Supports **Google GCM, Apple APNS, Amazon ADM**, etc.

![aws-sns.png](media/messaging/aws-sns.png)
- **Amazon SNS ‚Äì Security**
  - **Encryption:**
    - **In-flight:** Uses **HTTPS API**.
    - **At-rest:** Uses **KMS keys**.
    - **Client-side:** Users handle their own encryption/decryption.

  - **Access Control:**
    - **IAM policies** control SNS API access.
    - **SNS Access Policies** (like S3 policies) allow:
      - **Cross-account access** to SNS topics.
      - Other services (e.g., **S3**) to publish to SNS.

- SNS + xSQS: Fan Out:
  - **Push once in SNS**, all subscribed SQS queues receive the message.
  - **Fully decoupled** system with **no data loss**.
  - SQS allows message persistence, delayed processing, and retries.
  - **Scalable:** Add more SQS subscribers anytime.
  - **Access Control:** Ensure SQS policy allows SNS to write.
  - **Cross-Region Support:** Works with SQS queues in different regions (SNS can send to SQS in a different region).

![aws-sns-sqs-fan-out.png](media/messaging/aws-sns-sqs-fan-out.png)

- S3 events to multiple queues:
  - For the same combination of: event type (e.g. object create) and prefix
    (e.g. images/) you can only have one S3 Event rule
  - If you want to send the same S3 event to many SQS queues, use fan-out

![drafted-s3-event-fanout.png](media/messaging/drafted-s3-event-fanout.png)

- Usage: SNS to AWS S3 through Kinesis Data Firehose

![sns-s3-kdf.png](media/messaging/sns-s3-kdf.png)

- SNS - FIFO Topic
  - ordering of the messages in the topic

- SNS FIFO _ SQS FIFO: fan out
  - usage: fan out + ordering + deduplication

![sns-fifo.png](media/messaging/sns-fifo.png)
- SNS - Message Filtering
  - JSON policy used to filter messages sent to SNS topic's subscription
  - if a subscription doesn't have filter, it receives all messages

![sns-message-filtering.png](media/messaging/sns-message-filtering.png)

- SNS demos:

[sns-demo.gif](media/messaging/sns-demo.gif)

### AWS EventBridge
Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications using events.
- Receives events from AWS services, custom apps, or SaaS providers. 
- Routes events to targets like Lambda, Step Functions, SQS, SNS, and more. 
- Decouples services, enabling scalable and loosely-coupled architectures.
- Key features:
  - Schema discovery: Automatically detects the structure of incoming events. 
  - Event filtering: Only forward events that match specific patterns. 
  - Integrates with 200+ AWS services. 
  - Supports custom event buses for app-specific workflows.
- common use cases:
  - Automate workflows (e.g., run a Lambda when an EC2 instance starts). 
  - Connect microservices with real-time event-driven communication. 
  - React to SaaS events (e.g., Zendesk ticket created
- For comparison, SNS doesn't support third party destinations

![event-bridge-notification.jpg](media/messaging/event-bridge-notification.jpg)

### EventBridge Scheduler
**Amazon EventBridge Scheduler** is a fully managed service that lets you **schedule tasks or events** to run at specific times or intervals, without managing any infrastructure.

**Key features:**
- **One-time or recurring schedules**
- **Triggers AWS services** (like Lambda, Step Functions, or ECS)
- **Granular time control** (down to the minute)
- **Supports time zones and daylight saving adjustments**
- **Reliability and retry mechanisms** built-in

It's ideal for automating periodic workflows or timed operations in AWS.

### AWS Kinesis
- collect and store streaming data in **real-time**

![drafted-kinesis-data-stream.png](media/messaging/drafted-kinesis-data-stream.png)

**Kinesis Data Stream:**
- It is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming
- KDS make sure the streaming data is available to multiple real-time analytics applications, to S3, Lambda within 70 milliseconds of the data being collected.
- Its streams scale from MBs to TBs per hour & scale from thousands to millions of PUTs per second
- Adjust the throughput anytime
- Retention between 1 day to 365 days
- Ability to reprocess (replay) data or retry mechanism
- Once data is inserted in Kinesis, it can‚Äôt be deleted (immutability)
- Data that shares the same partition goes to the same shard (ordering) ‚Ä¢ Producers: AWS SDK, Kinesis Producer Library (KPL), Kinesis Agent
- Consumers:
  - Write your own: Kinesis Client Library (KCL), AWS SDK
  - Managed: AWS Lambda, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics
  - You have multiple consumers receiving data in parallel, the use enhanced fanout. See [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/kds-enhanced-fanout/).
  - Capacity Modes
    1. Provisioned
       - You choose the number of shards provisioned, scale manually or using API
       - Each shard gets 1MB/s in (or 1000 records per second)
       - Each shard gets 2MB/s out (classic or enhanced fan-out consumer) ‚Ä¢ You pay per shard provisioned per hour
    2. On-demand
       - No need to provision or manage the capacity
       - Default capacity provisioned (4 MB/s in or 4000 records per second)
       - Scales automatically based on observed throughput peak during the last 30 days
       - Pay per stream per hour & data in/out per GB
  - Demos

[kinesis-data-stream-demo.gif](media/messaging/kinesis-data-stream-demo.gif)

**Amazon Data Firehose:**
- data collected in firehose can be transformed using a lambda (ex. CSV to JSON).
- the data is stored in buffer and flushed once in a while into different destinations
- as in diagram, one can write data or failed data into S3 bucket
- automatic scaling, serverless, near-real-time with buffering capabilities
- supports:
  - CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro, Raw Text, Binary data
- conversion to parquet/ORC, compressions with gzip/snappy
- data 

**Kinesis Data Stream vs Amazon Data Firehose**
- KDS:
  - stream data collection
  - producer, consumer mode
  - real time 
  - provisioned/on-demand mode
  - upto 365 days data storage
  - replay capabilities
- ADF:
  - loading streaming data into S3/Redshift/OpenSearch/3rd Party etc
  - fully managed
  - near real-time
  - automatic scaling
  - no data storage
  - no replay capabilities
  - When KDS is set as the source for ADF, Kinesis Agent can't send directly to ADF, instead it should send to KDS

**SQS vs SNS vs Kinesis**

![sqs-sns-kinesis-comparison.png](media/messaging/sqs-sns-kinesis-comparison.png)

**Kinesis Data Analytics**
Refer to [Flink](#amazon-managed-service-for-apache-flink)
### Amazon MQ
- SQS & SNS are AWS proprietary protocols
- traditional apps might use open source protocols on-premise such as MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
- when migration from on-premise to AWS, instead of re-engineering the app with SQS & SNS, we use `AWS MQ`
- It managed message broker for:
  - RabbitMQ
  - ActiveMQ
- Amazon MQ doesn't scale as much as SQS/SNS
- runs on server, we need to use multi-AZ with failover
- Amazon MQ has queue feature (similar to SQS) and topic feature (similar to SNS)

![amazon-mq-ha.png](media/messaging/drafted-amazon-mq-ha.png)

## AWS containers: ECS, Fargate, ECR
- docker: see `bank docu service`

### AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)
- A container image is packaged code and dependencies
- launching docker container on AWS means launch `ECS tasks` on ECS clusters
- aws's own container platform
- EC2 launch type
  - in this type one must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
  - each EC2 instance will run the ECS agent to register in ECS cluster
  - finally aws takes care of starting/stopping containers

![img.png](media/containers/drafted-ecs-ec2-l-type.png)
- Fargate Launch Type:
  - we don't provision the infras (EC2 instances)
  - it is all serverless
  - aws runs ECS tasks based on the CPU / RAM you need

![drafted-ecs-fargate-l-type.png](media/containers/drafted-ecs-fargate-l-type.png)

- IAM Roles for ECS:
  - EC2 instance profile (EC2 Launch Type):
    - is used by ECS agent to make calls to ECS API, ECR (poll image), CloudWatch(send logs)
  - ECS Task Role: 
    - allows tasks to have specific role
    - that role allows it to call others i.e S3, DB etc
    - defined in task definition

![drafted-iam-roles-ecs.png](media/containers/drafted-iam-roles-ecs.png)

- ECS LB integration (in both launch types):
  - expose multiple ECS tasks as http or https endpoints

![img.png](media/containers/drafted-ecs-lb-int.png)
  - supported: 
    - ALB (for most use cases), 
    - NLB (recommended only for high throughput / performance use cases or to pair it with AWS private Link)

- ECS - Data volumes (EFS)
  - mount EFS file sys onto ECS tasks
  - work for both EC2 & Fargate
  - tasks running in any AZ share the same data in the EFS file system
  - Fargate + EFS = best of serverless setups
  - use case: multi-AZ shared storage for containers

![drafted-ecs-data-volume-efs.png](media/containers/drafted-ecs-data-volume-efs.png)

- Demos: ecs creation --> task definition --> service creation --> launched tasks --> update tasks
  - [ecs-creation-demo.gif](media/containers/ecs-creation-demo.gif)
  - [ecs-task-service-demo.gif](media/containers/ecs-task-service-demo.gif)
  - [ecs-interaction-service-update.gif](media/containers/ecs-interaction-service-update.gif)


- ECS service auto-scaling 
  - automatically increase/decrease the tasks
  - ECS uses aws application auto scaling, based on these metrics
    - CPU utilization of ECS service
    - Memory utilization of service
    - ALB request counts per target
  - auto-scaling types:
    - Target tracking: scaled based on target value of specific CloudWatch metric
    - Step scaling: based on specific CloudWatch alarm
    - Scheduled scaling scale based on specific time
  - ECS service autoscaling is different from EC2 auto-scaling
- EC2 Launch Type - Auto Scaling EC2 instances
  - scale EC2 instances?
    - auto-scaling group scaling: scale ASG based on CPU utilization
    - ECS cluster capacity provider:
      - as soon as you lack capacity to launch new task, it will automatically scale the ASG
      - capacity provider paired with ASG
      - finally add ec2 instances (CPU, RAM)
      - preferred scaling

  - SQS Queue Example

![ecs-solution-arch-3.png](media/containers/ecs-solution-arch-3.png)
  - Intercept Stopped Tasks using EventBridge

![ecs-solution-arch-4.png](media/containers/ecs-solution-arch-4.png)

- Note: when deleting the ecs service, set desired tasks to 0, then delete the service (cloudformation will do the resources cleanup including ALB etc)
  - finally delete the cluster
### AWS Fargate
- AWS own serverless container platform
- works with ECS & with EKS

### AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
- Store and manage Docker images on AWS
- Private & Public repository (Amazon ECR Public Gallery https://gallery.ecr.aws)
- Fully integrated with ECS, backed by Amazon S3
- Access is controlled through IAM (permission errors => policy)
- Supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning, image tags, image lifecycle, ...

![aws-ecr-ec2-integration.png](media/containers/aws-ecr-ec2-integration.png)

### AWS APP Runner
- fully managed service to deploy backend (API, microservices) and frontend by anyone. no knowledge of AWS
- underneath it uses AWS services and all the features like ASG, ELB, encryption etc
- it will scale if many request are coming to the app (httpd in demo)

![drafted-aws-app-runner.png](media/containers/drafted-aws-app-runner.png)

- Demo: 1. app runner service creation 2. interacting with the app runner
  1. [aws-app-runner-creation.gif](media/containers/aws-app-runner-creation.gif)
  2. [aws-app-runner-interaction.gif](media/containers/aws-app-runner-interaction.gif)

### AWS App2Container (A2C)
- CLI tool for migrating Java & .NET apps into docker container
- lift & shift migration
- migrate legacy apps without code changes
- process:
  - generate cloudformation template(compute, network etc)
  - register generated docker container to ECR
  - deploy to EKS, ECS or App Runner
  - support pre-built CI/CD pipelines

![drafted-aws-A2C.png](media/containers/drafted-aws-A2C.png)
## AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
- A way to launch managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS
- k8s is an open-source system for automatic deployment, scaling and management of containerized (usually Docker) application
- An alternative to ECS, similar goal but different API
- EKS supports both launch modes:
  - EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes 
  - or Fargate to deploy serverless containers
- Use case: if your company is already using Kubernetes on-premises or in another cloud, and wants to migrate to AWS using Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic (can be used in any cloud ‚Äì Azure, GCP...)
- For multiple regions, deploy one EKS cluster per region
- Collect logs and metrics using CloudWatch Container Insights

![aws-eks-multi-az.png](media/containers/aws-eks-multi-az.png)
  - each worker node is an EC2 instance

### **AWS EKS Node Types**

When running workloads in Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), you need to provide the compute resources‚Äî**nodes**‚Äîon which your containers will run. AWS offers three main ways to set up nodes in your EKS cluster, depending on how much control and maintenance responsibility you want.

---

#### 1. **Managed Node Groups**

**Overview:**
- AWS manages the lifecycle of EC2 instances (nodes) on your behalf.
- You define a group (node group), and AWS handles provisioning, scaling, and updating the nodes using an Auto Scaling Group (ASG).

**Key Features:**
- **Fully integrated with EKS:** Node provisioning and management are simplified using the AWS Console, CLI, or APIs.
- **Auto-scaling supported:** AWS automatically adjusts the number of nodes based on your scaling policies.
- **EKS-optimized AMI:** Automatically uses an Amazon EKS-optimized AMI, which includes the necessary Kubernetes components.
- **Update support:** Allows rolling updates to nodes without disrupting workloads.

**Instance Types:**
- Can use **On-Demand Instances** (pay for what you use) or **Spot Instances** (cheaper but can be interrupted by AWS).

**Best For:**
- Users who want a balance of flexibility and convenience without managing the infrastructure in detail.

---

#### 2. **Self-Managed Nodes**

**Overview:**
- You manually create EC2 instances and register them to your EKS cluster.
- You are responsible for configuring and maintaining the lifecycle of the nodes, often via your own Auto Scaling Group.

**Key Features:**
- **Greater customization:** You can use any AMI (including custom ones) or the official Amazon EKS-Optimized AMI.
- **Full control:** Gives you the ability to tweak every aspect of the instance configuration, including networking, security, and software packages.
- **Manual updates & scaling:** Unlike Managed Node Groups, you handle node upgrades, patching, and autoscaling yourself.

**Instance Types:**
- Also supports both **On-Demand** and **Spot Instances**.

**Best For:**
- Advanced users who need custom node configurations or want more control over node management.
- Use cases that require special security hardening, GPU support, or custom AMIs.

---

#### 3. **AWS Fargate**

**Overview:**
- A **serverless** compute engine for containers.
- You don‚Äôt manage any EC2 instances. AWS handles the provisioning and scaling of the infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- **No node management:** Ideal for those who want to avoid dealing with servers, patches, or scaling infrastructure.
- **Per-pod billing:** You pay for the vCPU and memory requested by individual pods, not for full EC2 instances.
- **Isolation and security:** Each pod runs in its own VM-isolated environment, improving security.

**Limitations:**
- Not all Kubernetes features are supported (e.g., daemonsets, privileged containers).
- Limited support for custom networking and storage configurations.

**Best For:**
- Small or simple workloads.
- Teams prioritizing ease of use and minimal infrastructure overhead.
- CI/CD jobs, microservices, or event-driven workloads.

### Amazon EKS ‚Äì Data Volumes
- Support for...
  - Amazon EBS
  - Amazon EFS (works with Fargate) 
  - Amazon FSx for Lustre
  - Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP

- Demo:
  - [eks-cluster-creation-demo.gif](media/containers/eks-cluster-creation-demo.gif)
  - [eks-node-group-demo.gif](media/containers/eks-node-group-demo.gif)
- using `eksctl` create k8s cluster on [aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html). 

### EKS and IAM Integration
- There are two types of accounts in k8s:
  - user account: for humans (i.e kubectl access)
  - service account: for pods (identity)
- Service account: in EKS, service account is an identity that the pods use to authenticate to k8s API and with IRSA to aws services
- IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) is a k8s feature
- First create IAM roles separately for each service running on EKS and then assign the roles to each k8s service account

### Zoning concepts:
- outer, middle, inner zones
- dev, test, preprod in outer zone belong to one k8s cluster
- prod in outer layer has its k8s own cluster
- however zone  outer includes dev, test, preprod, prod. So what is outer zone exactly?
- dev, test, preprod in middle zone belong to its own k8s cluster
- prod in middle zone has its own k8s cluster
- In Azure, a zone is a subnet

## Crossplane
- Crossplane is an open-source framework that enables you to manage infrastructure and services using Kubernetes APIs. 
- Key Features of Crossplane
  - Kubernetes-Native: Uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Controllers to manage resources. 
  Leverages the Kubernetes API, so you can use kubectl and familiar tools to manage infrastructure. 
  - Provider Support: Supports cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Azure, and on-premises environments. 
  Providers translate Kubernetes resources into API calls for these platforms. 
  - Infrastructure Compositions:You can create Compositions, which are reusable templates for infrastructure. 
  For example, a PostgreSQLInstance composition might include an RDS instance, a VPC, and security group. 
  - GitOps Friendly: Works seamlessly with GitOps tools like Argo CD and Flux to manage infrastructure declaratively. 
  - Multi-Tenancy and Separation of Concerns: Crossplane enables administrators to create high-level abstractions for developers, allowing developers to consume infrastructure without direct access to sensitive provider credentials.
- Use Cases 
  - Managing cloud resources (e.g., databases, storage, compute). 
  - Abstracting and templating infrastructure for consistency across teams. 
  - Integrating with CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure management. 
  - It turns Kubernetes into a universal control plane for provisioning and managing cloud-native resources, such as databases, virtual machines, and networks, as well as custom resources
- Upbound is the commercial company behind Crossplane.
- [Connect](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/getting-started/provider-aws/) Crossplane to AWS to create and manage cloud resources from Kubernetes with the [Upbound AWS Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-family-aws)
- In the context of Crossplane, the concepts of Composition, Definition, and Claim are part of its Composite Resource (XRC) framework. 
 They enable Crossplane to provide higher-level abstractions for infrastructure, making it easier for application developers to consume infrastructure without dealing with the complexity of raw cloud APIs.
### Examples:
- Create an AWS VPC as native k8s resource with 
  ```
  apiVersion: aws.composite.scc.bank.io/v1alpha1
  kind: DedicatedVPC
  ```
  
## AWS Serverless overview

- Developers don‚Äôt have to manage servers anymore.
- They just deploy code, or simply just deploy... functions. Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service)
- Serverless was pioneered by AWS Lambda but now also includes anything that‚Äôs managed: ‚Äúdatabases, messaging, storage, etc.‚Äù
- Serverless does not mean there are no servers... it means you just don‚Äôt manage / provision / see them

- Serverless in AWS
  - AWS Lambda
  - AWS Cognito
  - AWS API Gateway
  - Amazon S3
  - AWS SNS & SQS
  - AWS Kinesis Data Firehose
  - Aurora Serverless
  - DynamoDB
  - Step Functions 
  - Fargate
  - CloudFront
  - CloudWatch log
  - CloudWatch Events - Event Bridge

![a-pure-serverless-setup.png](media/serverless/a-pure-serverless-setup.png)

- Example integrations (use cases):
  - Serverless Thumbnail creation

![aws-lambda-use-case-1.png](media/serverless/aws-lambda-use-case-1.png)
  - Serverless CRON Job

![img.png](media/serverless/lambda-use-case-2.png)

### AWS Lambda
- EC2 vs Lambda
  - EC2:
    - Virtual Servers in the Cloud
    - Limited by RAM and CPU
    - Continuously running
    - Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers
  - Lambda
    - Virtual functions ‚Äì no servers to manage!
    - Limited by time - short executions
    - Run on-demand
    - Scaling is automated!
    - AWS lambda layer for reusable code
- Easy Pricing:
  - Pay per request (call)
    - First 1,000,000 requests are free
    - $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)
  - Pay per duration: (in increment of 1 ms)
    - 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month for FREE == 400,000 seconds if function's RAM is 1GB == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
    - After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
    - Free tier 400,000 GBs of compute time
  - You can find overall pricing [information](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/)
  - It is usually very cheap to run AWS Lambda --> popular

- Lambda Features:
  - Integrated with the whole AWS suite of services  
  - support for many programming languages:
    - Node.js (JavaScript), python, java, C#(.NET core), Ruby, 
    - Custom Runtime API (community supported, example Rust or Golang))
  - To reuse code in more than one aws lambda, consider using `aws lambda layer`
  - Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
  - Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 10GB of RAM!). Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!
  - Lambda Container Image
    - The container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API
    - ECS / Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images

- AWS Lambda Limits to Know - per region
  - Execution:
    - Memory allocation: 128 MB ‚Äì 10GB (1 MB increments)
    - Maximum execution time: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
    - Environment variables (4 KB)
    - Disk capacity in the ‚Äúfunction container‚Äù (in /tmp): 512 MB to 10GB
    - Concurrency executions: 1000 (can be increased by contacting aws support)
  - Deployment:
    - Lambda function deployment size (compressed .zip): 50 MB
    - Size of uncompressed deployment (code + dependencies): 250 MB
    - Can use the /tmp directory to load other files at startup 
    - Size of environment variables: 4 KB 
- Demo: lambda creation:
  - [lambda-creation-demo.gif](media/serverless/lambda-creation-demo.gif)

- Lambda Concurrency & Throttling:
  - concurrency limit: upto 1000 concurrent executions (1000 lambdas working in parallel)
  - one can set "reserved concurrency" at func level to limit the no. of concurrency. Invocation over limit --> throttled
    - if sync invocation --> throttle error 429
    - if asynch invocation --> retry automatically and then go to DLQ
  - higher exec above 1000 possible through support ticket
  - if we don't set limit, then:
    - at high invocations ALB fulfilled all request and consumed 1000 limit (account level)
    - all others will be throttled
  - Use `ConcurrentExecutions` or `Invocation exceed the expected threshold` CloudWatch alarms to monitor
  - 
![drafted-lambda-concurrency-issue.png](media/serverless/drafted-lambda-concurrency-issue.png)
![drafted-lambda-concurrency-issue-async.png](media/serverless/drafted-lambda-concurrency-issue-async.png)

  - Demo:
    - [lambda-concurr-demo.gif](media/serverless/lambda-concurr-demo.gif)
- Cold Start & Provisioned Capacity:
  - Cold start: 
    - code loaded + code outside handler run (init). 
    - If init is large (code, dependencies, SDK) this process can take some time.
    - first request has higher latency
  - provisioned concurrency:
    - pre-warmed instances that are ready to handle requests at all time
- Lambda SnapStart (at no extra cost):
  - Improves your Lambda functions performance up to 10x at no extra cost for Java, python & .NET and above
  - if enabled: function is invoked from a pre-initialized state (no function initialization from scratch)
  - When you publish a new version:
    - Lambda initializes your function
    - Takes a snapshot of memory and disk state of the initialized function
    - Snapshot is cached for low-latency access

![lambda-snap-start.png](media/serverless/lambda-snap-start.png)

- Customization at the Edge: Lambda at Edge and CloudFront
  - some modern apps need logic execution at the edge location, these code are called `edge function`
  - Edge function:
    - write and attach to CF
    - run close to user
    - CloudFront has two kinds of functions: CF functions and Lambda@Edge
    - deployed globally
    - use case: customize the CDN content
  - CF & Lambda@Edge use case:
    - Website Security and Privacy
    - Dynamic Web Application at the Edge
    - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
    - Intelligently Route Across Origins and Data Centers ‚Ä¢ Bot Mitigation at the Edge
    - Real-time Image Transformation
    - A/BTesting
    - User Authentication and Authorization
    - User Prioritization
    - User Tracking and Analytics
  - CF Functions:
    - Lightweight functions written in JavaScript
    - For high-scale (millions), latency-sensitive CDN customizations
    -  max memory: 2 MB
    - total package: 10 KB
    - execution time < 1ms
    - no access to n/w or file system access
    - Sub-ms startup times, millions of requests/second
    - Used to change Viewer requests and responses:
      - Viewer Request: after CloudFront receives a request from a viewer
      - Viewer Response: before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer
    - Native feature of CloudFront (manage code entirely within CloudFront)

![cf-functions.png](media/serverless/cf-functions.png)

  - Lambda@Edge
    - Lambda functions written in NodeJS or Python
    - execution time: 5 - 10 seconds
    - max memory: 128 MB - 10 GB
    - total package: 1 - 50 MB
    - Scales to 1000s of requests/second
    - Used to change CloudFront requests and responses:
      - Viewer Request ‚Äì after CloudFront receives a request from a viewer
      - Origin Request ‚Äì before CloudFront forwards the request to the origin
      - Origin Response ‚Äì after CloudFront receives the response from the origin
      - Viewer Response ‚Äì before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer
    - Author your functions in one AWS Region (us-east-1), then CloudFront replicates to its locations

![img.png](media/serverless/lambda-edge-function.png)

  - CloudFront Functions vs. Lambda@Edge - Use Cases
    - CF functions:
      - Cache key normalization
        - Transform request attributes (headers, cookies, query strings, URL) to create an optimal Cache Key
      - Header manipulation
        - Insert/modify/delete HTTP headers in the request or response
      - URL rewrites or redirects
      - Request authentication & authorization
        - Create and validate user-generated tokens (e.g., JWT) to allow/deny requests
    - Lambda@Edge:
      - Longer execution time (several ms)
      - Adjustable CPU or memory
      - Your code depends on a 3rd libraries (e.g., AWS SDK to access other AWS services)
      - Network access to use external ser vices for processing
      - File system access or access to the body of HTTP requests

- Lambda in VPC:
  - By default, your Lambda function is launched outside your own VPC (in an AWS-owned VPC) and have access to any public internet address or public aws API
  - Therefore, it cannot access resources in your VPC (RDS, ElastiCache, internal ELB...)

![lambda-vpc-default.png](media/serverless/lambda-vpc-default.png)
  - make it VPC-enabled when you need to access a private resource in a private subnet
    - once enabled, all traffic from your function is subject to the routing rules of your VPC/subnet and interact with public resources, it will need route through a NAT GW

  - we need to launch our lambda in our VPC (in private subnet): 
    - you need VPC ID, the subnet, and security group
    - lambda will then create an ENI in your subnet

![lambda-vpc-private.png](media/serverless/lambda-vpc-private.png)
  - Use case: 
    - use lambda with RDS Proxy: if lambda directly accesses the RDS, it may open many and create high load --> use RDS proxy (it pools connections)
      - RDS Proxy
        - Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
        - Improve availability by reducing by 66% the failover time and preserving connections
        - Improve security by enforcing IAM authentication and storing credentials in Secrets Manager
      - The Lambda function must be deployed in your VPC, because RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible 

![aws-rds-proxy.png](media/serverless/aws-rds-proxy.png)

- RDS - Invoking Lambda vs Event Notification
  - Invoking Lambda:
    - Invoke Lambda functions from within your DB instance
    - Allows you to process data events (access to DB data) from within a database
    - Supported for RDS for PostgreSQL and Aurora MySQL
    - Must allow outbound traffic to your Lambda function from within your DB instance (Public, NAT GW,VPC Endpoints)
    - DB instance must have the required permissions to invoke the Lambda function (Lambda Resource-based Policy & IAM Policy)

![rds-invoking-lambda.png](media/serverless/rds-invoking-lambda.png)
  - Event Notification:
    - Notifications that tells information about the DB instance itself (created, stopped, start, ...)
    - You don‚Äôt have any information about the data itself
    - Subscribe to the following event categories: DB instance, DB snapshot, DB Parameter Group, DB Security Group, RDS Proxy, Custom Engine Version
    - Near real-time events (up to 5 minutes)
    - Send notifications to SNS or subscribe to events using EventBridge

![rds-event-notification.png](media/serverless/rds-event-notification.png)

**Lambda db communication:**

**AWS Lambda to RDS using IAM authentication** allows your Lambda function to connect securely to an **Amazon RDS database** (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) **without hardcoding passwords**.

- How It Works:
  1. **Enable IAM DB authentication** on your RDS instance.
  2. **Create an IAM role** with permission to connect to RDS (`rds-db:connect`).
  3. **Attach the IAM role** to your Lambda function.
  4. In Lambda, generate a **temporary auth token** using the **`generate-db-auth-token`** AWS CLI/SDK.
  5. Use that token as the database password in the connection.

---
This method improves security by using **short-lived tokens** instead of static DB credentials.

## AWS No SQL - DynamoDB
- **Fully managed & available:**
  - NoSQL database with multi-AZ replication and integrated IAM security.
- **High scalability & performance:**
  - Supports millions of requests/sec, trillions of rows, hundreds of TB storage, and single-digit millisecond latencies.
- **Flexible schema:**
  - Uses tables with primary keys, supports evolving attributes and various data types (scalar, document, set) with a 400KB item limit.
  - items has attributes (& new ones can be added anytime unlike RDS)
- **Cost-efficient & maintenance-free:**
  - Offers auto-scaling and requires no patching (DB is already there).
- **Capacity options:**
  - Provisioned (pre-planned RCUs/WCUs with auto-scaling) and On-Demand (automatic scaling for variable workloads).
- Standard & Infrequent Access (IA) Table Class
- If schema changes rapidly, then DynamoDB is the choice
- DynamoDB + lambda tech stack --> key-value pair data processing and storing 

![img.png](media/serverless/dynamodb-table.png)

- Demos:
  - [dynamodb-create-table.gif](media/serverless/dynamodb-create-table.gif)

### DAX caching
- Provides an in-memory cache for reduced read latency (microseconds) with a default 5-minute TTL.
- helps solve read congestion
- fully compatible with DynamoDB API (no app code change/refactoring).
  - doesn't require developers to manage cache invalidation, data population or cluster management
- less read capacity is used which saves costs
- delivers upto 10x performance improvement - from milliseconds to microseconds - even at millions of requests per seconds

![dynamodb-acc-dax.png](media/serverless/dynamodb-acc-dax.png)
- Why not ElastiCache
  - both can be complementary
  - in ElastiCache one can store huge aggregated result

![dynamodb-dax-elasticache.png](media/serverless/dynamodb-dax-elasticache.png)

### DynamoDB Streams Processing
DynamoDB Streams is a feature of Amazon DynamoDB that captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) made to a table.
- Events from **DynamoDB Streams** are stored in a **highly available, managed stream** maintained by AWS, **separate from the table itself**. You don‚Äôt access them like a traditional database table‚Äîinstead, AWS stores them in an **internal stream buffer** that you can read from using:

- **AWS Lambda** (most common use via triggers)
- **Kinesis adapter** (for advanced stream processing)
- **DynamoDB Streams API** (low-level, for custom consumers)

**Storage specifics**
- **Retention**: Stream records are stored for **24 hours**.
- **Ordering**: Events are stored in **time order** per partition key.
- **Access**: You don‚Äôt see or manage the underlying storage‚ÄîAWS handles that entirely.

So, the events are **not stored in DynamoDB itself**, but in a **separate, managed stream** associated with your table.


In the context of **DynamoDB**, when we talk about **creating triggers**, it **specifically refers to using a Lambda function** that automatically runs in response to changes in the table via **DynamoDB Streams**.

So yes, **"triggers" in DynamoDB are essentially Lambda functions** that are associated with a stream on a table.

**Steps to create a trigger**
1. **Enable DynamoDB Streams** on your table.
2. Go to the **AWS Lambda Console**.
3. Create a **new Lambda function** (or use an existing one).
4. Under **"Function triggers"**, choose **DynamoDB** as the source.
5. Select your table and the stream ARN, and configure the batch size and permissions.

Once set up, the Lambda function is automatically **triggered** whenever the table is modified (insert, update, delete), and from there, you can integrate with SNS or any other service.


To integrate **Amazon SNS** with **DynamoDB Streams**, you use a **Lambda function as a trigger**. In DynamoDB, a *trigger* refers to a **Lambda function** that automatically runs when changes (inserts, updates, deletes) occur in the table, captured via **DynamoDB Streams**.

**How it works**
1. **Enable DynamoDB Streams** on your table to capture data changes.
2. **Create a Lambda function** and configure it as a **trigger** for the stream.
3. In the Lambda function, process the incoming stream events and **publish messages to an SNS topic**.
4. **Subscribe other services** (e.g., email, SQS, other Lambdas) to the SNS topic to receive notifications.

**Example use case**
A new order is inserted into a DynamoDB table ‚Üí DynamoDB Stream captures the event ‚Üí triggers a Lambda ‚Üí Lambda sends an alert via SNS to notify a support team.

---

This setup is **serverless**, real-time, and great for building reactive, event-driven architectures.

- use cases:
  - react in real time (welcome emails to users)
  - real-time usage analytics
  - insert into derivative tables
  - implement cross-region replication

- Two stream processing types on DynamoDB:
  - DynamoDB streams
    - 24 hours retention
    - limited # consumers
    - process using lambda triggers or dynamodb stream kinesis adapters
  - Kinesis Data Stream (new): send all streams to it
    - 1 year retention
    - high # consumers
    - process using lambda, kinesis data analytics, Kinesis Data Firehose, Glue, Streaming ETL

![drafted-dynamodb-stream.png](media/serverless/drafted-dynamodb-stream.png)

### DynamoDB Global Tables
- Make a DynamoDB table accessible with low latency in multiple-regions
- Active-Active replication (2-ways)
- Applications can READ and WRITE to the table in any region
- Must enable DynamoDB Streams as a pre-requisite: 
  - DynamoDB streams enable DB to get changelog and use that to replicate data across replica tables in other aws regions

![dynamodb-global-table.png](media/serverless/dynamodb-global-table.png)
### DynamoDB TTL
- automatically delete an item after an expiry timestamp
- Use cases: reduce stored data by keeping only current items, adhere to regulatory obligations, web session handling...

![img.png](media/serverless/dynamodb-ttl.png)

### DynamoDB - backups for DR
  - **Continuous Backups using point-in-time recovery (PITR)**
    - Can be enabled for up to 35 days
    - Allows recovery to any point within the backup window
    - Restores data by creating a new table
  - **On-Demand Backups**
    - Full backups retained until explicitly deleted
    - No impact on performance or latency

## Serverless Solution Architecture:
- Scenario One (whole setup pay-per-usage):
  - A serverless mobile app with a REST API over HTTPS, using managed serverless authentication. 
  - Users interact with their S3 folders and manage to-dos (mostly read-heavy). 
  - The database must scale with high read throughput.
  - outcome:
    - serverless REST API: HTTP

![full-serverless-architecture.png](media/serverless/full-serverless-architecture-1.png)

---

#### ‚úÖ How it helps in a multi-department setup:

| Scenario                             | Benefit of EMR Runtime Roles                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dept A runs Spark, needs S3 bucket A | Assign a role **only** with access to `s3://dept-a-data/*`    |
| Dept B runs Hive, needs DynamoDB B   | Use a **different runtime role** for access to DynamoDB B     |
| Shared EMR cluster across teams      | **Same cluster**, but **different roles per job/user/team**   |
| Fine-grained data access             | Prevents accidental or unauthorized cross-team access         |

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è How it's implemented:
1. Create **separate IAM roles** per team or job type (e.g., `EMRRuntimeRole-TeamA`, `EMRRuntimeRole-TeamB`).
2. Attach policies scoped to their specific data/resources.
3. When submitting jobs (via **EMR Studio**, **CLI**, or **SDK**), **specify the runtime role**.
4. EMR automatically assumes that role **just for that job**.

---

#### üß† Bonus:
- This pattern supports **multi-tenancy**, **auditability**, and **cost tracking**.
- Works well with **EMR Serverless** and **EMR on EKS**, too.

## AWS Security & Encryption - KMS, SSM parameter store, Shield, WAF
**Encryption in Transit (TLS/SSL)**
- Encrypts data before transmission and decrypts it upon arrival.
- Uses TLS certificates for secure HTTPS communication.
- Prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- see `TLS/SSL` sections under LB & S3 sections

![client-user-login.png](media/encryption-security/client-user-login.png)

**Server-Side Encryption at Rest**
- Encrypts data upon receipt and decrypts it before transmission.
- Stores data in encrypted form using a data key.
- Requires key management, with the server needing access to the keys.

![server-side-encryption.png](media/encryption-security/server-side-encryption.png)

**Client-Side Encryption**
- Data is encrypted by the client and never decrypted by the server.
- Only the receiving client can decrypt the data.
- The server cannot access or decrypt the data.
- Supports Envelope Encryption.

![client-side-encryption.png](media/encryption-security/client-side-encryption.png)

### KMS
AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
- Anytime you hear ‚Äúencryption‚Äù for an AWS service, it‚Äôs most likely KMS 
- AWS manages encryption keys for us
- Fully integrated with IAM for authorization
- Easy way to control access to your data
- Able to audit KMS Key usage using CloudTrail
- Seamlessly integrated into most AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, SSM...)
- Never ever store your secrets in plaintext, especially in your code! 
  - KMS Key Encryption also available through API calls (SDK, CLI)
  - Encrypted secrets can be stored in the code / environment variables
- Upon KMS key deletion it goes into `pending deletion` status
- KMS family & types:
  - KMS Keys is the new name of KMS Customer Master Key
  - Symmetric (AES-256 keys)
    - Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt
    - AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs
    - You never get access to the KMS Key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
  - Asymmetric (RSA & ECC key pairs)
    - Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair
    - Used for Encrypt/Decrypt, or Sign/Verify operations
    - The public key is downloadable, but you can‚Äôt access the Private Key unencrypted
    - Use case: encryption outside of AWS by users who can‚Äôt call the KMS API

  - Key types:
    - AWS Owned Keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key)
    - AWS Managed Key: free (aws/service-name, example: aws/rds or aws/ebs) ‚Ä¢ 
    - Customer managed keys created in KMS: $1 / month
    - Customer managed keys imported: $1 / month

- pay for API call to KMS ($0.03 / 10000 calls)

Automatic Key rotation:
  - AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year
  - Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic & on-demand
  - Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias

Copying Snapshots across regions

![kms-key-region-scoped.png](media/encryption-security/kms-key-region-scoped.png)

**KMS Key Policies** control access to KMS keys, ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to S3 bucket policies. The difference: you cannot control access without them
- Default KMS Key Policy:
  - Created if you don‚Äôt provide a specific KMS Key Policy
  - Complete access to the key to the root user = entire AWS account
- Custom KMS Key Policy:
  - Define users, roles that can access the KMS key
  - Define who can administer the key
  - Useful for cross-account access of your KMS key

**Copying snapshots across accounts**
1. Create a Snapshot, encr ypted with your own KMS Key (Customer Managed Key)
2. Attach a KMS Key Policy to authorize cross-account access
3. Share the encr ypted snapshot
4. (in target) Create a copy of the Snapshot, encrypt it with a CMK in your account
5. Create a volume from the snapshot

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "CrossAccountSnapshotCopy",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCrossAccountAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID:root"
            },
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:CreateGrant",
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:ReEncrypt*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "kms:CallerAccount": "SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID",
                    "kms:ViaService": "ec2.REGION.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
**Demo**

[kms-customer-managed-key-demo.gif](media/encryption-security/kms-customer-managed-key-demo.gif)

**KMS Multi-Region Keys**

![kms-multi-region-key.png](media/encryption-security/kms-multi-region-key.png)

- Identical KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangeably
- Multi-Region keys have the same key ID, key material, automatic rotation... ‚Ä¢ Encrypt in one Region and decrypt in other Regions
- No need to re-encrypt or making cross-Region API calls 
- KMS Multi-Region are NOT global (Primary + Replicas)
- Each Multi-Region key is managed independently
- Use cases: 
  - global client-side encryption, 
  - encryption on Global DynamoDB, 
  - Global Aurora
  - storing s3 bucket data in multiple regions using the same encryption key.

DynamoDB Global Tables and KMS Multi-Region Keys Client-Side encryption
- We can encrypt specific attributes client-side in our DynamoDB table using the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client
- Combined with Global Tables, the client-side encrypted data is replicated to other regions
- If we use a multi-region key, replicated in the same region as the DynamoDB Global table, then clients in these regions can use low- latency API calls to KMS in their region to decrypt the data client-side
- Using client-side encryption we can protect specific fields and guarantee only decryption if the client has access to an API key

![dynamodb-global-table-encrypt.png](media/encryption-security/dynamodb-global-table-encrypt.png)

Global Aurora and KMS Multi-Region Keys Client-Side encryption
- We can encrypt specific attributes client-side in our Aurora table using the AWS Encryption SDK
- Combined with Aurora Global Tables, the client-side encrypted data is replicated to other regions
- If we use a multi-region key, replicated in the same region as the Global Aurora DB, then clients in these regions can use low-latency API calls to KMS in their region to decrypt the data client-side
- Using client-side encryption we can protect specific fields and guarantee only decryption if the client has access to an API key, we can protect specific fields even from database admins

![aurora-g-table-mkey-encrypt.png](media/encryption-security/aurora-g-table-mkey-encrypt.png)

**S3 Replication ‚Äì Encryption Considerations** - When replication is enabled

- **Default Replication**: Unencrypted objects and SSE-S3 encrypted objects replicate automatically.
- **SSE-C Encrypted Objects**: Can be replicated.
- **SSE-KMS Encrypted Objects**: Require additional configuration:
  - Enable replication for SSE-KMS.
  - Specify the KMS key to encrypt the objects in target bucket.
  - adapt the kms key policy for the target key.
  - Create and use an IAM role that allow the s3 replication service to `kms:Decrypt` (source key) and `kms:Encrypt` (target key).
  - Handle potential KMS throttling by requesting a Service Quotas increase.
- **Multi-Region KMS Keys**: Supported but treated as independent keys‚ÄîS3 decrypts and re-encrypts objects during replication.

AMI Sharing Process (Encrypted via KMS)

1. The AMI in the **source account** is encrypted with a KMS key from the same account.
2. Grant **Launch Permission** to the **target AWS account** by modifying the image attributes.
3. Share the **KMS key** used to encrypt the AMI‚Äôs snapshot with the target account or its IAM role.
4. The **IAM role/user** in the target account must have permissions for:
  - `DescribeKey`, `ReEncrypt`, `CreateGrant`, and `Decrypt` on the shared KMS key.
5. (Optional) The **target account** can specify a new KMS key to re-encrypt the volumes when launching an EC2 instance from the AMI.

  - Access your application from the edge
  - Integration with Shield for DDoS protection
  - Helpful if your backend is not compatible with CloudFront
- BP3 ‚Äì Route 53
  - Domain Name Resolution at the edge
  - DDoS Protection mechanism

**Best practices for DDoS mitigation**
- Infrastructure layer defense (BP1, BP3, BP6)
  - Protect Amazon EC2 against high traffic
  - That includes using Global Accelerator, Route 53, CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing
- Amazon EC2 with Auto Scaling (BP7)
  - Helps scale in case of sudden traffic surges including a flash crowd or a DDoS attack
- Elastic Load Balancing (BP6)
  - Elastic Load Balancing scales with the traffic increases and will distribute the traffic to many EC2 instances 

**Application Layer Defense**
- Detect and filter malicious web requests (BP1, BP2)
  - CloudFront cache static content and serve it from edge locations, protecting your backend
  - AWS WAF is used on top of CloudFront and Application Load Balancer to filter and block requests based on request signatures
  - WAF rate-based rules can automatically block the IPs of bad actors
  - Use managed rules on WAF to block attacks based on IP reputation, or block anonymous Ips
  - CloudFront can block specific geographies
- ShieldAdvanced(BP1,BP2,BP6)
  - Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation automatically creates, evaluates and deploys AWS WAF rules to mitigate layer 7 attacks

**Attack surface reduction**
- Obfuscating AWS resources (BP1, BP4, BP6)
  - Using CloudFront, API Gateway, Elastic Load Balancing to hide your backend resources (Lambda functions, EC2 instances)
- Security groups and NetworkACLs (BP5)
  - Use security groups and NACLs to filter traffic based on specific IP at the subnet or ENI-level
  - Elastic IP are protected by AWS Shield Advanced
- Protecting API endpoints(BP4)
  - Hide EC2, Lambda, elsewhere
  - Edge-optimized mode, or CloudFront + regional mode (more control for DDoS)
  - WAF + API Gateway: burst limits, headers filtering, use API keys

## Amazon VPC
There is a default VPC created. Without it, it would be very difficult for newcomers. For PROD, create your own.
![aws-vps-diagram.png](media/vpc/aws-vps-diagram.png)

- Understanding CIDR ‚Äì IPv4
  - Classless Inter-Domain Routing ‚Äì a method for allocating IP addresses 
  - Used in Security Groups rules and AWS networking in general
    - We‚Äôve seen `XX.XX.XX.XX/32` &rarr; one IP
      We‚Äôve seen `0.0.0.0/0 &rarr; all IPs

![ip-range-example.png](media/vpc/ip-range-example.png)

A CIDR consists of two components
- Base IP
  - Represents an IP contained in the range (XX.XX.XX.XX)
  - Example: 10.0.0.0,192.168.0.0,...
- Subnet Mask
  - Defines how many bits can change in the IP
  - Example: /0, /24, /32
  - Can take two forms: 
    - /8 &larr;&rarr; 255.0.0.0
    - /16 &larr;&rarr; 255.255.0.0

![subnet-mask-range.png](media/vpc/subnet-mask-range.png)

Check online [here](https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr).

### Public vs. Private IP (IPv4)
- The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and public (Internet) addresses
- **Private IP** can only allow certain values:
  - 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) &larr; big networks
  - 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12) &larr; AWS default VPC in that range
  - 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) &larr; e.g., home networks
- All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are Public

VPC components:
- Network ACL
- Subnets
- Internet Gateway
- Route table

### **VPC in AWS ‚Äì IPv4 Overview**

- **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud) allows you to create isolated networks within AWS.
- You can have up to **5 VPCs per region** (soft limit).
- Each **VPC** can have a **CIDR block** with a range from **/28 (16 IPs)** to **/16 (65,536 IPs)**.
- Only **private IPv4 ranges** are allowed within VPCs:
- Ensure your **VPC CIDR** does not overlap with other networks (e.g., corporate).

This allows for flexible, isolated network configurations within AWS.

VPC ‚Äì Subnet (IPv4)
- AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
- These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can‚Äôt be assigned to an EC2 instance
- Example: if CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, then reserved IP addresses are: 
  - `10.0.0.0` ‚Äì Network Address
  - `10.0.0.1` ‚Äì reserved by AWS for the VPC router
  - `10.0.0.2` ‚Äì reserved by AWS for mapping to Amazon-provided DNS
  - `10.0.0.3` ‚Äì reserved by AWS for future use
  - `10.0.0.255 ‚Äì Network Broadcast Address. AWS does not support broadcast in aVPC, therefore the address is reserved
- Exam Tip, if you need 29 IP addresses for EC2 instances:
  - You can‚Äôt choose a subnet of size /27 (32 IP addresses, 32 ‚Äì 5 = 27 < 29)
  - You need to choose a subnet of size /26 (64 IP addresses, 64 ‚Äì 5 = 59 > 29)

### **Internet Gateway (IGW)**

An **Internet Gateway (IGW)** enables **VPC resources** (e.g., EC2 instances) to connect to the internet.

- **Horizontally scalable, highly available, and redundant**.
- **Created separately** and **attached to only one VPC** at a time.
- **Does not provide internet access by itself**‚Äî**route tables must be configured**.

Demo

[vpc-internet-gw-creation-demo.gif](media/vpc/vpc-internet-gw-creation-demo.gif)
### **Bastion Hosts**

A **Bastion Host** provides **secure SSH access** to private EC2 instances.

- **Placed in a public subnet**, connecting to private subnets.
- **Security Group Rules:**
  - **Bastion Host**: Allows **inbound SSH (port 22)** only from **trusted CIDRs** (e.g., corporate IPs).
  - **Private EC2 Instances**: Allow SSH access from the **Bastion Host's security group** or its **private IP**.

This setup ensures **controlled access** while keeping private instances secure.

### **NAT Instance (Legacy but Exam-Relevant)**

A **NAT (Network Address Translation) Instance** enables **EC2 instances in private subnets** to access the internet while keeping them private.

**Key Requirements:**
- Must be in a **public subnet** with an **Elastic IP**.
- **Source/Destination Check** must be **disabled**.
- **Route tables** must direct private subnet traffic to the NAT instance.
- Uses a **pre-configured Amazon Linux AMI** (support ended on **Dec 31, 2020**).
- Port forwarding√ñ Directs traffic from one port/IP to another

**Limitations & Considerations:**
- **Not highly available** ‚Äì Requires **Auto Scaling Group (ASG) across multiple AZs** for resilience.
- **Bandwidth limited** by the EC2 instance type.
- **Security Group Rules:**
  - **Inbound:** Allow **HTTP/HTTPS** from private subnets, **SSH** from your home network.
  - **Outbound:** Allow **HTTP/HTTPS** to the internet.

**Note:** NAT Instances are outdated; **NAT Gateways** are the preferred alternative.
![vpc-nat-instance.png](media/vpc/vpc-nat-instance.png)

Demo:

[vpc-nat-instance-demo.gif](media/vpc/vpc-nat-instance-demo.gif)

### **NAT Gateway**

A **fully managed, high-availability NAT service** that enables private subnet EC2 instances to access the internet.

**Key Features:**
- **AWS-managed** ‚Äì No administration, automatic scaling (5 Gbps ‚Üí 100 Gbps).
- **Elastic IP & IGW required** (Private Subnet ‚Üí NATGW ‚Üí IGW).
- **Per-hour + bandwidth costs** apply.
- **Created in a specific AZ** and **cannot be used by EC2 in the same subnet**.
- **No Security Groups required**.

**Preferred over NAT Instances** due to better performance and reliability.

**NAT Gateway & High Availability**

- **Resilient within a single AZ** but not across AZs.
- **For fault tolerance**, deploy **multiple NAT Gateways** in different AZs.
- **No cross-AZ failover needed**‚Äîif an AZ goes down, affected resources don‚Äôt need NAT.

![nat-gw-high-availability.png](media/vpc/nat-gw-high-availability.png)

  - [vpc-nat-gw-interaction-demo-1.gif](media/vpc/vpc-nat-gw-interaction-demo-1.gif)

### Security Groups & NACLs

![sg-nacl-comparison.png](media/vpc/sg-nacl-comparison.png)

**Network ACL (NACL)**

- **Subnet-level firewall** controlling **inbound & outbound traffic**.
- Each **subnet has one NACL** (default assigned to new subnets).
- **Rules are numbered (1‚Äì32766)**; lower numbers have **higher precedence**.
- **First matching rule applies** (e.g., **#100 ALLOW > #200 DENY**).
- **Last rule (*) denies all traffic** if no match is found.
- **New NACLs deny all traffic by default**.
- **Recommended rule increments: 100**.
- **Useful for blocking specific IPs at the subnet level**.

**Default NACL:**
- **Allows all inbound & outbound traffic** for associated subnets.
- **Do not modify** the Default NACL‚Äîcreate a **custom NACL instead**.

![default-nacl.png](media/vpc/default-nacl.png)

**Ephemeral Ports**

- Used for **temporary responses** in client-server connections.
- Clients connect to a **defined port** and receive responses on an **ephemeral port**.
- **Port ranges vary by OS:**
  - **Windows 10 & IANA:** 49152‚Äì65535
  - **Linux Kernels:** 32768‚Äì60999
- see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html) for more

### **VPC Peering**
- **Privately connects two VPCs** over AWS‚Äô network using private IPv4 or IPv6
- **Acts as a single network**, but **CIDRs must not overlap**.
- **Not transitive**‚Äîeach VPC needs a **direct peering connection**.
- **Route tables must be updated** in both VPCs for communication.
- Supports **cross-account and cross-region peering**.
- **Security groups** can reference instances in a **peered VPC (same region, cross-account supported)**. i.e reference like `accountId/security-group`

### VPC sharing 
See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html)
### VPC Endpoints
- AWS services have public URLs.
- VPC Endpoints enable private network access to AWS services, bypassing the public Internet.
- Highly available, redundant, and scalable.
- Eliminates the need for IGW, NATGW, etc.
- Troubleshooting:
  - Verify **DNS Resolution** in your VPC.
  - Check **Route Tables**.

![vpc-endpoint-conn-options.png](media/vpc/vpc-endpoint-conn-options.png)

**Types of VPC Endpoints**

- **Interface Endpoints** (PrivateLink)
  - Creates an **ENI** (private IP) as an entry point (**requires Security Group**)
  - Supports most AWS services
  - **Costs:** $/hour + $/GB

- **Gateway Endpoints**
  - Creates a **gateway**, used as target in route tables (**no Security Group needed**)
  - Supports only **S3 & DynamoDB**
  - **Free**

![img.png](media/vpc/vpc-endpoint-types.png)
- Gateway or Interface Endpoint for S3
  - in the exam gateway type is always preferred because it is free
  - Interface is preferred only for access from on-premises (VPN/Direct Connect), another VPC, or a different region 

![s3-access-s2s-vpn-direct-conn.png](media/vpc/s3-access-s2s-vpn-direct-conn.png)

Demos

### Summary - VPC Setup Journey
![vpc-setup-complete-journey-1.png](media/vpc/vpc-setup-complete-journey-1.png)

---
### AWS Site-to-Site VPN
AWS Site-to-Site VPN connects your on-premises network to your AWS VPC using a secure and encrypted connection over the public internet.

Components Involved:
- Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
  - VPN concentrator on the AWS side of the VPN connection
  - VGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-Site VPN connection
  - Possibility to customize the ASN (Autonomous System Number)
- Customer Gateway (CGW)
  - This is your on-premises **VPN device** (physical or software).
  - Must provide a **public IP address**:
    - If CGW is **behind NAT**, use the **public IP of the NAT device** (NAT-T must be enabled).
  - Refer to AWS-tested [Customer Gateway Devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/your-cgw.html#DevicesTested)
- Site-to-Site VPN Connection
---
- **üîå Setting Up the Site-to-Site VPN Connection**
  - **1. Create and Attach the VGW**
    - Attach the VGW to your target VPC.
  - **2. Configure the CGW**
    - Set up your VPN device (use tested devices when possible).
    - Ensure public IP address is reachable.
  - **3. Create the VPN Connection**
    - Link the VGW and CGW.
    - Configure tunnel options (static or dynamic routing using BGP).
  - **4. Route Propagation**
    - Enable **Route Propagation** for the VGW in your **route table**.
    - This allows traffic between on-premises and VPC.
  - **5. Security Groups**
    - To allow **ping/ICMP** from on-premises to EC2:
      - Add **ICMP** protocol to **inbound rules** of your EC2‚Äôs security groups.

![vpc-setup-complete-journey-2.png](media/vpc/vpc-setup-complete-journey-2.png)

![aws-site-to-site-vpn-routing.png](media/vpc/aws-site-to-site-vpn-routing.png)

**AWS VPN CloudHub**
- Provide secure communication between multiple sites, if you have multiple VPN connections
- Ideal for **hub-and-spoke topology** using VPN over the internet.
- It‚Äôs a VPN connection so it goes over the public Internet
- To set it up,connect multiple VPN connections on the same VGW, setup dynamic routing (BGP) and configure route tables

![aws-vpn-cloudhub.png](media/vpc/aws-vpn-cloudhub.png)

**Demo**

[aws-s2s-vpn-connection-demo.gif](media/vpc/aws-s2s-vpn-connection-demo.gif)

**Question**: want to speed s2s VPN connect, check [Transit Gateway](#transit-gateway-site-to-site-vpn-ecmp) with ECMP

### AWS Direct Connect (DX)

AWS Direct Connect provides a **dedicated, private network connection** between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS. 
It does **not traverse the public internet**, offering **more consistent network performance**, **lower latency**, and **higher bandwidth**.

---

**Features**

- **Private connectivity** from your data center, office, or colocation to AWS.
- Access both **public AWS services** (like S3) and **private resources** (like EC2 in a VPC) over the same connection.
- Requires:
  - A **Direct Connect location**
    - A Direct Connect location is a physical data center facility where AWS has a presence with networking equipment that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection between your infrastructure and AWS
    - i.e Interxion FRA6 in Frankfurt
  - A **Virtual Private Gateway** (VGW) or **Transit Gateway** attached to your VPC.
- Supports both **IPv4 and IPv6 traffic**.

---
- Direct Connect Architecture  
  ![aws-direct-conn-diagram.png](media/vpc/aws-direct-conn-diagram.png)

**Use Cases:**

- **Large-scale data transfers** (cost-effective at higher bandwidths).
- **Real-time data** workloads needing **consistent performance**.
- **Hybrid cloud architectures** integrating on-premises and cloud resources.
- **Compliance** scenarios requiring private connections (no internet exposure).

---

**Direct Connect Gateway (DXGW):**

- Allows you to **connect to multiple VPCs across different regions** using a **single Direct Connect connection**.
- VPCs must be in the **same AWS account** (or use AWS Resource Access Manager for cross-account).
- Simplifies multi-region architecture without needing multiple physical connections.

![aws-direct-connect-gw.png](media/vpc/aws-direct-connect-gw.png)

---

**Connection Types:**

**1. Dedicated Connections**
  - Speeds: **1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps**
  - Provisioned by requesting through **AWS** directly.
  - AWS allocates a **dedicated Ethernet port** at a DX location.

**2. Hosted Connections**
  - Speeds: **50 Mbps to 10 Gbps**
  - Provisioned via approved **Direct Connect Partners**.
  - **Scalable bandwidth** (can adjust capacity as needed).
  - Availability may vary by partner and region.
  - **Lead time**: Typically **over 1 month** to complete setup.

---

**Encryption Considerations**
- **Direct Connect is not encrypted** by default.
- However, it is inherently **private** and does not use the public internet.
- For **encryption over DX**, combine it with a **VPN connection (IPsec)**:
  - Adds security
  - Increases configuration complexity

![direct-connect-encryption.png](media/vpc/direct-connect-encryption.png)

---

**Resiliency & Backup Options:**

To ensure availability in case of a Direct Connect failure:

- Option 1: **Backup Direct Connect**
  - Secondary physical connection
  - High cost, but best performance and availability

![direct-connect-backup-connection.webp](media/vpc/direct-connect-backup-connection.webp)
- Option 2: **Site-to-Site VPN**

### AWS Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway enables you to **connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks** using a **hub-and-spoke (star) architecture**.

**Key Features:**
- **Regional service**, but supports **cross-region peering**.
- Allows **cross-account sharing** via **AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)**.
- **Custom route tables** control how VPCs and networks communicate.
- Integrates with **Direct Connect Gateway** and **VPN** for hybrid connectivity.
- Supports **IP Multicast** ‚Äì the **only AWS service** that does.
---

![complicated-nw-topology.png](media/vpc/complicated-nw-topology.png)
- basically: VPC peering + direct connect + VPN connection --> Transit Gateway

### Transit Gateway: Site-to-Site VPN ECMP
- ECMP = Equal-cost multi-path routing
- Routing strategy to allow to forward a packet over multiple best path
- Use case: 
  - create multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections to **increase** the bandwidth of your connection to AWS

![aws-transit-gw-with-ecmp.png](media/vpc/aws-transit-gw-with-ecmp.png)

**Transit Gateway: throughput with ECMP**
![transit-gw-throughput-ecmp.png](media/vpc/transit-gw-throughput-ecmp.png)

**Transit Gateway ‚Äì Share Direct Connect between multiple accounts**
![shared-direct-conn-multiple-ac.png](media/vpc/shared-direct-conn-multiple-ac.png)

### Resource Access Manager (RAM)
**AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)** lets you **share AWS resources** with other **AWS accounts** or **within your organization (via AWS Organizations)**.

üîπ **Key Points**
- Enables **secure resource sharing** without needing to copy resources (substantially reducing operational overhead).
- Commonly shared resources:
  - VPC subnets
  - Transit Gateways
  - License Manager configurations
  - Route 53 Resolver rules
- You control **who can access** and **what they can do**.

---

üîπ **Use Case Example**
- Share a **VPC subnet** across multiple accounts so that EC2 instances in different accounts can launch into the same network (VPC).

---

In short: **AWS RAM** simplifies **cross-account resource sharing** while keeping it **secure and managed**.

![aws-recource-access-manager.png](media/vpc/aws-recource-access-manager.png)
### Shared Services VPC
- Instead of having the shared services in each, put it centrally and save administrative overhead and costs
- VPC endpoints are h-scaled, highly available VPC components.
- The endpoits allow comm. between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your n/w traffic.
- it reduces data transfer charges resulitng from n/w comm. b/w private vpc and the aws services
![shared-vpc-with-transit-gw.jpg](media/vpc/shared-vpc-with-transit-gw.jpg)

### Transit VPC
A **Transit VPC** is a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** used as a **central hub** to route traffic between multiple **spoke VPCs** or **remote networks** (like on-premises data centers) in a hub-and-spoke architecture. 
It simplifies network management by centralizing connectivity, often using **VPNs or AWS Transit Gateway** to route traffic securely and efficiently.
- It generates additional data transfer charges for traffic traversing the transit VPC.

![transit-vpc.jpg](media/vpc/transit-vpc.jpg)

### VPC - Traffic Mirroring
‚úî **Captures & inspects** network traffic in your VPC in a non-intrusive manner
‚úî Done by routing the traffic to **your security appliances**.

**Traffic Flow:**
- **Source (From):** ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces).
- **Target (To):** Another ENI or a **Network Load Balancer**.

**Key Features:**
- Capture **all packets** or **specific packets** (optional truncation).
- Source and target are in the same VPC or across VPCs if  **VPC Peering** is enabled.

**Use Cases:**
üîπ **Content inspection**  
üîπ **Threat monitoring**  
üîπ **Troubleshooting**

![vpc-traffic-mirroring.png](media/vpc/vpc-traffic-mirroring.png)

### **IPv6 in AWS**

- **IPv4** has **4.3B addresses**, nearing exhaustion.
- **IPv6** is the successor, offering **3.4 √ó 10¬≥‚Å∏ addresses**.
- **All AWS IPv6 addresses are public & internet-routable** (no private range).
- **Format:** `x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x` (hexadecimal, `0000` to `ffff`).
- **Examples:**
  - `2001:db8::` (zero compression)
  - `::1234:5678` (leading zeros omitted)

### **IPv6 in VPC**

‚úî **IPv4 is always enabled**; IPv6 can be added for **dual-stack mode**.  
‚úî **EC2 instances get:**
- A **private IPv4** & a **public IPv6**.
- Can access the internet via an **Internet Gateway** using **either protocol**.

![ipv6-in-vpc.png](media/vpc/ipv6-in-vpc.png)
### **IPv6 Troubleshooting**

‚ö† **IPv4 cannot be disabled** for VPCs/subnets.  
‚ö† If an **EC2 instance won‚Äôt launch**, it‚Äôs **not due to IPv6 exhaustion**.  
‚úÖ **Cause:** No available **IPv4 addresses** in the subnet.  
‚úÖ **Fix:** Assign a **new IPv4 CIDR** to the subnet.

![ipv6-troubleshooting.png](media/vpc/ipv6-troubleshooting.png)

Demo

[aws-ipv6-demo.gif](media/vpc/aws-ipv6-demo.gif)

### Egress-only Internet Gateway
- Used for IPv6 only
- (similar to a NAT Gateway but for IPv6)
- Allows instances in your VPC outbound connections over IPv6 while preventing the internet to initiate an IPv6 connection to your instances
- You must update the Route Tables

![egress-only-internet-gw.png](media/vpc/egress-only-internet-gw.png)

## CloudFormation
AWS CloudFormation is a declarative tool for defining and provisioning AWS infrastructure. Instead of manually creating resources, you describe them in a template, and CloudFormation builds them in the correct order.

**Example:**
- Define a security group
- Launch two EC2 instances using that security group
- Create an S3 bucket
- Set up a load balancer (ELB) in front of the EC2 instances  
  CloudFormation then provisions these resources as specified.

---

### Benefits of CloudFormation

**1. Infrastructure as Code**
- No manual resource creation‚Äîensures consistency and control
- Infrastructure changes are reviewed through code

**2. Cost Management**
- Resources in a stack are tagged for cost tracking
- Estimate costs directly from the template
- Cost-saving strategy: Automate resource deletion after work hours (e.g., 5 PM) and recreation in the morning (e.g., 8 AM)

**3. Productivity & Automation**
- Quickly create and destroy infrastructure as needed
- Auto-generate architecture diagrams
- Declarative approach‚Äîno need to manage dependencies manually

**4. Reusability & Extensive Support**
- Use existing templates from the AWS community
- Comprehensive AWS resource support (with custom resources for unsupported ones)

CloudFormation simplifies infrastructure management, making deployments efficient, repeatable, and cost-effective.

- CloudFormation Stackset
AWS **CloudFormation StackSet** is a feature that allows you to **deploy CloudFormation stacks across multiple AWS accounts and regions** from a single template.
  - Key Points:
    - **Centralized management**: Create, update, or delete stacks in multiple accounts/regions in one go.
    - **Multi-account support**: Ideal for organizations using AWS Organizations.
    - **Automation**: Useful for enforcing consistent infrastructure (e.g., IAM roles, VPCs) across environments.
    - **Delegated administration**: You can allow other accounts to create StackSets using a shared admin account.

In short, StackSets make it easy to **scale infrastructure as code** across a distributed AWS environment.

## GitOps
GitOps is a modern operational framework that uses Git as the single source of truth for managing infrastructure and applications. 
It leverages Git repositories to store and version all declarative configurations and relies on automated processes to ensure the actual state of the system matches the desired state defined in Git.
GitOps bridges the gap between development and operations by applying DevOps principles to infrastructure and application delivery, emphasizing automation, collaboration, and traceability.
- Core Principles of GitOps
  - Declarative:
  All infrastructure and application configurations are described declaratively, often in YAML or JSON files. These files define the desired state of the system.

  - Versioned and Immutable:
  Configurations are stored in Git repositories, providing a version-controlled, auditable history. This makes rollbacks easy by reverting to a previous commit.

  - Automatically Applied:
  Changes to the Git repository trigger automated processes (e.g., CI/CD pipelines or tools like Argo CD) to reconcile the actual system state with the desired state.

  - Continuous Reconciliation:
  The system is continuously monitored and reconciled to match the state defined in Git. If there‚Äôs drift (unexpected changes), the system reverts to the desired state or alerts the user.
- GitOps Tools
  Several tools help implement GitOps practices, especially for Kubernetes-based environments:

  - Argo CD: A Kubernetes-native GitOps tool for deploying and managing applications.
  - Flux: Another Kubernetes-native GitOps tool focused on continuous delivery.
  - Jenkins X: Integrates GitOps workflows with Jenkins pipelines.
  - Crossplane: Works with GitOps tools to provision and manage infrastructure.
  - Terraform Cloud: Extends GitOps for infrastructure provisioning.

## IaC and Infrastructure
1. Order you cloud profile
2. Order VPC
2. Order K8s cluster
3. Order and configure global registry (images etc) (Harbor on aws)
4. Order and config jenkins

## Documentation
- MkDocs:
  is an excellent choice for creating and managing toolchain documentation due to its simplicity, extensibility, and developer-friendly nature. 
- It is a static site generator specifically designed for creating documentation projects from Markdown files.


## Authentication/Authorization

# Disaster Recovery
- Application domain driven
- Infrastructure domain driven
- Disaster recovery models:
  - pilot light
  - warm standby
  - multi-site

# Software Solution Architect - General Approach
- from 500 to 5000 users and slow system? increase the instance type to something like t2.large or M5 (but with downtime)
  - better scale horizontally
- evolve: downtime --> h-scaling --> many IPs? route 53 --> one IP down due to TTL user's bad experience --> ELB + health checks
- Stateless Application:

![stateless-app-multi-az.png](media/stateless-app-multi-az.png)

- Stateful Application:
  - points which were considered throughout the optimization above:
    - ELB sticky session activation
    - web client storing app cookies and making our app stateless
    - ElastiCache:
      - for storing session (alternative DynamoDB)
      - for caching data from RDS
      - Multi-AZ considerations
    - RDS:
      - storing user data like name, birthday
      - scaling read with replicas
      - Multi-AZ for DR
    - tight security with security groups referencing each other

![stateful-app-optimization.png](media/stateful-app-optimization.png)
  - Another App for storing Images:
    - EBS okay only in single instance setup
    - EFS is preferred in distributed application
  
![drafted-image-storage-app-not-optimal.png](media/drafted-image-storage-app-not-optimal.png)
![drafted-image-storage-app-optimal.png](media/drafted-image-storage-app-optimal.png)

- Application instantiation speed up
  - EC2 instances:
    - Golden AMI:
      - install you applications, OS dependencies etc beforehand and launch your EC2 instances from golden AMI
    - User Data: for dynamic config, use User Data Scripts
    - Hybrid: mix Golden AMI & User data (Elastic Beanstalk)
  - RDS Databases:
    - Restore from a snapshot: the db will have schemas and data ready. This would be much more efficient than running a huge insert query
  - EBS volumes:
    - restore from a snapshot: the disk will already be formatted and have data
- BeanStalk:
  - It is a developer centric view of deploying applications on AWS to save time for doing all manual setups of EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS etc
  - It is managed service
  - It is free but we pay for the underlying resources
  - It consists of these components:
    - application
    - application version
    - environment
      - collection of AWS resources running an application
      - tiers: web server env tier and worker env tier
      - dev, test, prod envs
